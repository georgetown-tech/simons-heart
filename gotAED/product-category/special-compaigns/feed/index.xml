										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work for Hope Harbor. An organization in Claremore, OK that is dedicated to helping children and families heal from trauma in their past. We are a residential program and have both boys and girls. We are located in rural Oklahoma and it can sometimes take a while before paramedics can get to our facility. We have house parents that are older and children who suffer from trauma histories that can lead to early health issues. An AED would help to save lives if a situation were to come about and the EMS workers were delayed on getting to our facility in time.</p>
