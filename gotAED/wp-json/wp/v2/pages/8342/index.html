Should Schools Have Defibrillators?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<p>Are AEDs required to be in schools? They protect students. They save lives. They drastically improve the chance of surviving sudden cardiac death. They reduce the number of wrongful death and negligence claims against school districts. They would sit perfectly next to the fire alarm and fire extinguisher. But, the answer is maybe, depending upon where you live.<\/p>\n<p>Most school districts appreciate the importance of AED devices; however, they struggle to afford the AED devices. Few states are willing to pass legislation that forces schools to incur this cost. As such, most of the laws about AED devices recommend that schools have them, instead of requiring schools to have them. The majority of states that make them mandatory usually do not provide funding so the law is considered an unfunded mandate.<\/p>\n<p>There is research on the importance of having AED devices in schools:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.onlinejacc.org\/content\/69\/13\/1735\">Requirements for AEDs in Schools<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/29095383\">AEDs in High Schools &#8211; Disparities<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The following states <u>require<\/u> schools to have an AED device.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/alisondb.legislature.state.al.us\/alison\/codeofalabama\/1975\/16-1-45.htm\">Alabama<\/a> \u2013 An AED shall be placed in each public K \u2013 12 school.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/law.justia.com\/codes\/arkansas\/2016\/title-6\/subtitle-2\/chapter-10\/section-6-10-122\">Arkansas<\/a> \u2013 State Board of Education shall create rules that require each school campus to have an AED.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2009\">California<\/a> \u2013 Every school (public or charter) must have one AED device; the device must be available to coaches and athletic trainers during events.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flsenate.gov\/laws\/statutes\/2011\/1006.165\">Florida<\/a> \u2013 Each school that is a member of the Florida High School Athletic Association must have an AED on school grounds and it must be registered with local emergency.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.capitol.hawaii.gov\/session2014\/bills\/HB1747_.htm\">Hawaii<\/a> \u2013 All public schools shall have an AED.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mdrules.elaws.us\/comar\/13a.05.10.03\">Maryland<\/a> \u2013 Each county board shall develop and implement a high school and middle school AED program that includes at least one device that is available during school-sponsored athletic events.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mainelegislature.org\/legis\/bills\/bills_123rd\/billtexts\/HP124701.asp\">Maine<\/a> \u2013 A school administrative unit shall equip every school with an AED.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/malegislature.gov\/Laws\/GeneralLaws\/PartI\/TitleXII\/Chapter71\/Section54C\">Massachusetts:<\/a>\u00a0 Each school shall have an AED where instruction is provided.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/education\/students\/safety\/health\/legislation\/JanetsLawFAQ.pdf\">New Jersey<\/a> \u2013 Janet\u2019s Law requires every school (public and private) to have an AED device that is clearly marked and always available.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.p12.nysed.gov\/sss\/schoolhealth\/schoolhealthservices\/Article19Sections.html#917\">New York<\/a> \u2013 Schools shall provide and maintain an AED \u00a0in each instructional school facility.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/ode\/educator-resources\/standards\/physicaleducation\/Pages\/Automated-External-Defibrillator-.aspx\">Oregon<\/a> \u2013 Every school campus, (public and private), must have one AED device.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scstatehouse.gov\/code\/t59c017.php\">South Carolina<\/a> \u2013 If there is money from the General Assembly, each school district shall develop and implement an AED program in each high school.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/legiscan.com\/TN\/text\/HB0776\/2019\">Tennessee<\/a> &#8211;\u00a0 All public schools must have at least one AED within the school.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/statutes.capitol.texas.gov\/SOTWDocs\/ED\/htm\/ED.38.htm\">Texas<\/a> \u2013 Each school district shall have at least one AED.
