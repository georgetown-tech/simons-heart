It is open only to any individual who is interested in helping make Montgomery County safer and wants additional cash for educational expenses.<\/li>\n<li>Only registrations of AEDs located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania will be counted.<\/li>\n<li>To be eligible for Contest and scholarship money, the participant must register at https:\/\/www.gotaed.org\/scholarship\/, provide a name, school name, email and birthday and download the PulsePoint application on a smartphone. The app may also be found at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pulsepoint.org\">http:\/\/www.pulsepoint.org<\/a>. Simon\u2019s Heart is not responsible for any failure to properly register an AED through PulsePoint or for any technical or other failures of the PulsePoint system.<\/li>\n<li>A particular AED may only be registered once by a particular participant, but the same AED may be registered by multiple contestants.<\/li>\n<li>Registration of an AED is fulfilled by downloading the application and uploading a Compliant Photo of an AED.<\/li>\n<li>A Compliant Photo contains the AED device and its surroundings, as well as a description of the AED location.<\/li>\n<li>Points will be awarded as follows: 2 points will be awarded for the registration of an AED that has not previously been registered; 1 point will be awarded for the registration of an AED that was previously registered. Points will only be awarded to AEDs properly recorded by the PulsePoint system.<\/li>\n<li>At the conclusion of each calendar month, the participant who has uploaded a minimum of five (5) Compliant Photos and has earned the most points during that particular calendar month, will receive $250 from Simon\u2019s Heart. In the event that multiple participants share the high point total at the end of a particular calendar month, the winner will be determined by the most unique AEDs uploaded. In the event that multiple participants share the same high point total and the same number of unique AED uploads, the contestant that uploaded Compliant Photos on the most number of different calendar days will be deemed the winner.<\/li>\n<li>The contest will run on a monthly basis until terminated by Simon\u2019s Heart in its sole discretion. Participants are permitted to enter contests in multiple month.<\/li>\n<li>No substitution of the offered scholarship may be made and no cash will be given in lieu of the prize.<\/li>\n<li>Winners will be notified by email by the 20 th day of the month immediately following the month that Compliant Photos were uploaded.<\/li>\n<li>Each entrant acknowledges that he or she is aware that the IRS, and applicable state taxing authorities, treat prizes as ordinary income for tax purposes and that the winner is responsible for payment of any and all taxes related to his or her winnings.<\/li>\n<li>This offer is void where prohibited by law.<\/li>\n<li>There is absolutely no fee or other consideration required to enter or participate in the contest.<\/li>\n<li>We reserve the right to suspend, cancel or change these rules.<\/li>\n<li>Information contained herein is provided for informational purposes only.
