We are launching this crowd-funding campaign in response to recent cardiac events at both the national and local level. Football and Competitive Cheerleading, even at the youth level, are intense sports requiring physical fitness, conditioning, and endurance training. We owe it to our athletes to be prepared in the event of a serious emergency while they are in our care. We currently ensure that all of our coaches are CPR and AED certified however that training can only go so far if we do not have a machine accessible and readily available for use in the case of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>We are searching for any assistance in purchasing 1-2 AED machines with the necessary cardiac pads so we can ensure the health, safety, and a future for all of our athletes. <\/p>\n<p>Your donation would be tax deductible &#8211; Donations to the campaigns are made to Simon\u2019s Heart, a 501(c)(3) organization.
