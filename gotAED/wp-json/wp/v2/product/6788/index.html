As part of my B&#8217;nai  Mitzvah project I am raising money to donate 13 AED&#8217;s to the local youth sports organizations.  My friends on the LM travel team agreed to help me complete this goal.  Below is a  glimpse at my story.  <\/p>\n<p>Almost 4 years ago I had a near fatal drowning after suffering from a sudden cardiac arrest while swimming at my Uncle&#8217;s pool in rural Virginia.  I had almost lost my life, and only due to the quickness and know-how of my Uncle &#8211; performing CPR and the arrival of an AED; was I able to survive and am here to share my story.  I had just turned 9 years old when this happened.  I am about to turn 13 and will become a B&#8217;nai Mitzvah (I am a triplet) because of CPR and an AED!  <\/p>\n<p>After being in the hospital on life support and in a coma, we returned to the area and my Father and I saw that there were no AED&#8217;s at any of the fields that we play on and use almost daily.  We worked with the local township and school district to get them to approve and place AED&#8217;s at these fields and continue to make the fields safer for everyone within LM Township.<\/p>\n<p>I would not want ANY family to have to go through what we have gone through, especially if it is preventable.  <\/p>\n<p>To raise the money for the 13 AED&#8217;s, we are holding a Pitch, Hit and Run competition along with a Home Run Derby to spread awareness and raise money to fund this project. <\/p>\n<p>Please help us achieve this goal!   <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hello, my name is Sam Wizov.
