I believe that PW is in need of Automated External Defibrillator equipment. Starting in 2015, PWHS has been undergoing major construction. Larger spaces are being built to hold more students, teachers, and parents at once. The Cafeteria is one of those areas.

We should have aid in the event of a cardiac event. Time is so important in these situations. I\u2019m proposing that we have an AED device installed and give people the chance to learn how to use it in case of an emergency.
