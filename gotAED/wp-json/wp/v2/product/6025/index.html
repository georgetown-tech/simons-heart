My name is Katie Williams. I am a teacher here at Livingston Academy High School, as well as, the head coach of both the girls&#8217; and boys&#8217; soccer teams. This is currently my 3rd year of coaching high school soccer and the need for an AED is of great importance. Here at Livingston Academy, we have several outdoor sports (soccer, tennis, softball\/baseball, track\/cross country) with no AED in close proximity. We, the coaches would absolutely love for an AED to be placed at the soccer field house, due to its location being in the center of all outdoor sports, but unfortunately, like many low-income areas, funding is an issue when it comes to extra-curricular activities. Safety is our school&#8217;s number one concern &#038; we have several young student-athletes that we need &#038; want to keep safe! With sudden cardiac arrest being the leading cause of student-athlete deaths, please help us get an AED, so we can prevent this issue.
