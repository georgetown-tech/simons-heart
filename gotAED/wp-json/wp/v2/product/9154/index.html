I am a proud parent of a daughter who plays travel softball for Wisconsin Scorpions; which is located out of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  <\/p>\n<p>I want to thank all of those who donated to our first campaign, Action for Avery.  Because of the generosity of:  players, sponsors, friends and family; along with the support of Project ADAM, Got AED and Simon&#8217;s Heart, we were able to raise enough funds to get our first AED.  All within a few days !!<\/p>\n<p>Double Header &#8211; Action for Avery, is the second campaign to obtain another AED machine.  This past year, Wisconsin Scorpions has expanded to 5 teams, and works with approximately 60 girls, ages 10 to 19.  Our Organization plays in approximately 8 tournaments per season; and the teams are typically split between 2 venues.  Having access to 2 AED machines would ensure that there would be one at each location.<\/p>\n<p>The original campaign began because of one young woman&#8217;s battle with myocarditis, secondary to contracting COVID-19.  Avery continues to heal from her heart condition; but her ability to play softball is questionable.  I am again asking for your assistance in spreading the word about:  Double Header &#8211; Action for Avery; the possible side effects of COVID-19 on the hearts of our young athletes; and the benefits of having access to an AED device at athletic events.     <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Kim Robbins.
