I am a proud parent of a daughter who plays travel softball for Wisconsin Scorpions; which is located out of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.  During this past year, one of our players, Avery, contracted Covid-19.  After recovering, her mom reported that she would become winded after exercise and had some tightness in her chest- but nothing that she considered a problem.  However, as part of NCAA requirements for Avery to return to college softball, after having what they considered a &#8220;serious case&#8221; of Covid, she had to undergo an EKG and MRI.  The devastating news came from the Cardiologist on January 22, 2021.  Avery had developed myocarditis due to damage caused from Covid-19.  Her Cardiologist reported that it could take 3 to 6 months for it to heal&#8230;or it might never repair itself.  Avery has begun to receive treatment for the myocarditis; but only time will tell if it will be effective.  For now, her college and travel softball playing days are on hold.  Her college coach at Concordia University of Wisconsin has made Avery a manager, so she can continue to be part of the team and attend games.  This campaign originated  from Avery&#8217;s recent development of heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>Action for Avery is my campaign to obtain 2 AED machines for the Wisconsin Scorpions facility in Fond du Lac (and have the ability to take them during travel season).  This past year, Wisconsin Scorpions has expanded to 5 teams, and works with approximately 60 girls, ages 10 to 19.<br \/>\nIt has been reported by the CDC that an estimated 16% of children (ages 0-17) with the Covid infection are asymptomatic &#8211; which translates into undetected heart conditions.  I want to be proactive in the event that one of the girls (parents, siblings, spectators) collapses and requires resuscitation and\/or the use of an AED.  <\/p>\n<p>Help me raise the funds necessary to obtain 2 AED&#8217;s and spread awareness of the damage Covid-19 can cause in otherwise healthy young adults.  Like Avery.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Kim Robbins.
