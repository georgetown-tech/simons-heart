But did you know sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in student athletes?  Often times, there are no warning signs prior to SCA.  When an athlete suffers SCA timing is crucial to ensuring survival and access to an AED is critical.  North Harrison Youth Football League is asking for help from our supporters by raising funds to purchase 2 AEDs.  These AEDs will remain available during games and practices for our flag football, tackle football and cheerleaders in case of an emergency.  As a parent to 2 football players and the president of the league, I understand how necessary this is for our program.  But we need your help!
