I am responsible for over 500 student athletes&#8217; acute emergency care, in addition to many other roles required to keep our athletes going. Upon my arrival at this high school, I was disheartened in seeing, per my own assessment, that there are not enough AEDs available to what this school\/facility needs. While we could use more than 1 AEDs to responsibly cover our facilities, one I am passionate about providing for my athletes and coaches and bystanders is an AED that is on my person at all times. My thinking is this way I am 3 minutes (by golf cart) away from anyone potentially needing this, in addition I am trained in cardiac situations, especially those needing an AED to be used. When I am not on the premises, I would like the AED to be stored in a weather resistant cabinet available to anyone using our facilities, i.e. parks and rec teams. While this AED would primarily be used for the high school athletes, there are a number of people on our schools&#8217; campus at any time &amp; this would be beneficial in any situation. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Emily Huss, I am an Outreach Athletic Trainer lucky enough to be placed with Midlothian High School.
