We create experiences that help students and educators understand their environment and discover the impact they can have on their world and their community. Our mission is to provide exceptional learning experiences that inspire lifelong environmental stewardship. Our place-based learning programs on Bainbridge Island, in Woodinville, and in Seattle serve more than 12,000 students every year. We deepen our impact by co-developing science curriculum with Seattle Public Schools, providing teacher training, offering a Master\u2019s level graduate program in education, and through advocacy. We are truly a school in the woods. Though we currently have a dedicated indoor AED in our education and administration building, much of our learning takes place outdoors around the campus. We are looking to crowdfund a mobile AED device to accompany students as they hike the natural sites we have and learn about nature, secure in the knowledge that a portable AED device is close by with our EMT certified school program coordinator.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IslandWood is an environmental learning center on a 250-acre campus on Bainbridge Island just 30 minutes from downtown Seattle.
