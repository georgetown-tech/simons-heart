We have taken this group of young men from the ages of 8-9 up through the age of 13 to date and begun the process of molding them into successful students and athletes, to one day hopefully give back to society themselves.  We coach them to play baseball and be better young men.  Our team plays at Crellin Park in Chatham; as well as all throughout upstate NY.  Currently the team or field does not have an AED on site.  When we travel, most fields do not have one.
