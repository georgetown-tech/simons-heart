In the short time I have been involved with the program I have tried my best to help improve the equipment in all aspects of the program from the on field equipment to the practice tackling dummy\u2019s to the off the field emergency equipment. I\u2019m light of recent events I have become more aware of some of the scarier less talked about injuries in football. I also know it shouldn\u2019t take an incident like that to bring awareness, however it has really opened my eyes and I\u2019m trying to gather the necessary equipment to be able to save a life if god forbid we as coaches should ever be put in that situation. We are teaching other people\u2019s children a very physical game and with the potential of injury lurking around every corner I\u2019d like to be as prepared as possible. As a correctional officer I am always cpr and aed certified and I am always up so date with all of my certifications.
