HYSA is a non-profit, volunteer based organization whose mission is to promote affordable, competitive soccer in our county and develop talented young players by helping them grow both physically and mentally to their highest potential all while encouraging sportsmanship, teamwork, respect and fair play among players of all age levels, coaches, parents and audiences. Our soccer program consists of recreational and travel soccer with 1000 kids between the ages 3-16 and it&#8217;s growing!<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in the United States, taking the lives of 350,000 adults every year? This is more than lung cancer, breast cancer and AIDS, combined. But, SCA is not just an adult thing. It is the leading cause of death of student athletes and takes the lives of thousands of students annually.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, HYSA recognizes the need to have properly trained personnel in place along with an accessible AED device available at our soccer fields. The strenuous exertion of the game of soccer demands preparations be in place to deal with the unthinkable. Research shows that someone has the best chance of survival if an AED is used within the three minutes of a person collapsing. In fact, using an AED device increases the chances of survival by seventy percent. This campaign will provide an AED that will be available at all HYSA fields (games and practices).The device will be dedicated to the soccer fields and will always be available to anyone using the fields.<\/p>\n<p>Your donation will help our program be prepared for the most terrifying event at a sports contest. Thank you for your help.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi My name is Antonio Illiano, president of Hammonton Youth Soccer Association (HYSA).
