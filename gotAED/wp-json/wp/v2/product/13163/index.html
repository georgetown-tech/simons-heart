Our travel baseball team is community based, here in Wayland. All but one of our players is from Wayland. Most of these boys have been playing travel baseball together for 6 years. They are 12 &amp; 13 year olds. My son is one of them and I am part of the Dirt Dawgs board. The facility where the team practices, is in Hillards Michigan. There is no AED machine on-site. Wayland Union Schools do have AED machines in place, but we do not practice at the schools. When we travel for tournaments I have never seen an AED machine on-site. This scares me to death!!! I cannot imagine the feeling of complete helplessness if we were to witness a child or adult go down at a practice or tournament!!! This is why I\u2019m requesting an AED unit that we can take with us everywhere we go!!! I am also setting up a program wide (we have 5 teams in our organization) CPR training class for our coaches and parents ASAP!! I am willing to do whatever it takes to fundraise enough for my sons team to qualify for this unit as well as maintain it! Please consider our team for this opportunity!<br \/>\nThank you,<br \/>\nLori Atwell<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are a non profit organization.
