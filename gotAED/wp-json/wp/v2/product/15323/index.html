We have games that bring many other small rural schools to our ball fields and also the fields are open for the community to use and practice on. Due to the location of the fields they are located back behind the high school baseball field and not close to the main road, this can make it not the most accessible area to get to in the event of an emergency and we have lots of grandparents and community members that attend practice and games.  We also share an ambulance service with a town that houses the nearest ambulance 14 miles away which is another reason it would be wonderful to have an AED on site in case of an emergency.  Our volunteer fire department is wonderful in town and we have many first responders in town, but it would be wonderful to have this equipment readily available in case of an emergency. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Andrea Watkinson and I am a board member of the Central City Summer Youth Board that supports the Tball-6th grade baseball and softball programs of Central City, Iowa.
