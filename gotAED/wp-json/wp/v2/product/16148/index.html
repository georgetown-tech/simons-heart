Daycares are not required to have an AED in Arkansas. Along with high quality CPR, delivering a shock from an AED within three minutes of sudden cardiac arrest can greatly increase survival chances (by 70%!). From the moment I learned this, I have been working with the director, applying for grants, researching prices and trying to find the best way to help his school obtain an AED. My son, Matteo, has a heart condition, anaphylactic food allergies, and has already experienced an apneic (not breathing) life threatening event requiring an overhead &#8220;Code Blue&#8221; call at Arkansas Children&#8217;s Hospital. This site provides a way to raise the money for an AED, assistance in creating a plan, and information about maintaining the AED. I will just save my own money and buy one if I need to. If you can help, we would greatly appreciate it! It&#8217;s very important to me that my son, his twin brother and all of the staff and children at his daycare have quick access to an AED. It could mean life or death for all of them. Thank you for considering donating or sharing. If you are unable to donate, please share on social media. Thank you!  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Through working with Project Adam, I learned my son&#8217;s daycare did not have an AED.
