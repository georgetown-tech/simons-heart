The organization is 13 years old and is a family run and operated.  All coaches, board members and community helpers are volunteering their time and skills.  We are practice in a rural area in an empty lot, that was turned into a field with the help of people in the community that volunteer to come out to prepare the land each season.  We have 3 teams (ages 6-8, 9-10, and 11-12) and each year we make it to the playoffs and have won 5 superbowls in the 13 seasons that we have been in existence.  Our organization does not charge a fee for uniforms and equipment and we recycle them every season to keep registration fee minimal.  The best thing about the organization and the community that supports us, is that everyone is treated like family and the safety and fun experience for the kids is our top priority.  This AED would truly be a blessing to the organization in a way that we won&#8217;t have to pass the cost of it on to the parents and our children will be safe at all times on the field.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am co-founder and coach of the Riley Hill Eagles, a youth football league based in Wendell, NC.
