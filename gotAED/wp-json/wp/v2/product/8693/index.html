Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death among student-athletes and an AED device is the only tool that can save them. With that being said, the importance of having an AED machine in our school is crucial. The Cyberschool services roughly 400 students K4-8th and we are currently in the process of starting a high school. Funds are limited this year due to Covid and that we are a charter school in the inner city of Milwaukee. Please consider donating for this important medical device so we are never in a situation where we can&#8217;t save a child&#8217;s life. I promise your donation will make a difference.
