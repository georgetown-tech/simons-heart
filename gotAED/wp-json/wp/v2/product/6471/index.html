If it weren\u2019t for an automated external defibrillator (AED) in his backpack and quick response from a nearby EMS, Will wouldn\u2019t be with us today. Each year Sudden Cardiac Arrest claims the lives of 2000 children. Early emergency treatment with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and an AED can help restart a stopped heart and allow return of a normal heartbeat to help prevent sudden cardiac death. The chances of survival goes from 10% to 60% just by use of early CPR and AED use. Although rare, Will is proof these situations do occur.<\/p>\n<p>For this drive, I am trying to raise enough money to keep a portable AED with adult and pediatric pads on the First National Bank complex in Beaver, Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>Please help us reach a goal and support your fellow Eastern Eagles!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi, my name is Jill Downing.
