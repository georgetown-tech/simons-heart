The day care is not in immediate proximity to any major hospitals and paramedic\/emergency response times to the area may not always be quick enough as it is located in a rural part of Vermont. No one ever thinks they will need an AED until it is too late. I don&#8217;t want that to happen to mine or any other families&#8217; child. I want them to have every option available to potentially save a child&#8217;s life, which I&#8217;m sure all parents can understand and relate to. This day care facility provides care and a safe place for kids of all ages. It is my goal to have this day care have an AED on hand at all times so the employees have the ability to save a child&#8217;s life. I fully believe this day care and community would benefit greatly from having access to an AED, while not only putting parents at ease, but also giving the employees all necessary lifesaving equipment to save a child&#8217;s life.<br \/>\nThank you<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My son will be starting with Shellie&#8217;s Play Place very soon and I want to be sure that he and all the other kids there have the best access to life-saving care and resources.
