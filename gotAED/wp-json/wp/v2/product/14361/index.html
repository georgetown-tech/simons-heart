Unfortunately, sudden cardiac events can occur in young athletes, and we want to take every possible step to be prepared in case of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we are launching a campaign to acquire an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) for our organization. An AED is a portable device that can help to restore a normal heart rhythm in the event of a sudden cardiac event. Time is of the essence in these situations, and having an AED on hand can make all the difference in saving a life.<\/p>\n<p>According to the American Heart Association, sudden cardiac events are the leading cause of death in young athletes. These events can occur with little to no warning, and they can happen to even the healthiest and most active young people. By having an AED readily available, we can ensure that we are prepared to act quickly and effectively in the event of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to raise enough funds to purchase an AED for each of our fields. We believe that this investment in the safety of our players is well worth it. We are asking for donations from our community, as well as reaching out to local businesses and organizations for support.<\/p>\n<p>With your help, we can make sure that Donelson Baseball is a safe place for all of our young athletes to play and grow. Let&#8217;s come together to make this campaign a success and provide peace of mind to all of our families. Thank you for your support.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a youth baseball organization, Donelson Baseball is committed to providing a safe environment for all of its players.
