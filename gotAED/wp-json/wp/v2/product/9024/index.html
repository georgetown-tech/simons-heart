We realize that emergencies can occur anytime and can involve people from any age group. Our desire is to have our own AED (automatic external defibrillator) at our school so that it can be used to help save the life of the patient should an emergency occur. These machines are costly and need to be maintained to ensure that if and when it needs to be used that it is in good working order. The cost of the machine alone is approximately $1,200 to $1,400 and that does not include funds for the required maintenance. Despite the cost, we know that the patient has a better chance of survival if life saving measures can be implemented quickly. Please help us raise funds to purchase the AED. It could be YOUR child that benefits from it.
