We help young athletes develop their abilities while striving to be a positive influence on personal development.  We enable young athletes to choose their training and competitive intensity.<\/p>\n<p>I am Corey Danelski, Program Director for the ski club.   Myself and the coaching staff offer a variety of freestyle, snowboard  and alpine training programs for all levels of skill and commitment for athletes ages 7-19.  Last year we had 115 athletes participated in the club.  We are a youth ski racing club that trains at Spirit Mountain in Duluth, MN.  We own a two story building &#8220;Team Room&#8221; located on the Spirit Mountain property that athletes use for training.  We have first aid kits, stop the bleed kits, and other safety equipment located in our Team Room.  Our coaches are trained in American Heart First Aid, CPR and AED, they have completed concussion training and are all Safesport complaint.<\/p>\n<p>Skiing and snowboarding are high risk sports.  We do everything we can to help prevent and\/or prepare ourselves for an accident.   We install safety netting on the hill to protect an athlete from sliding into the woods,  Ski coaches always have eye contact on the athletes and all parts of the hill.  Coaches also carry radios to keep in contact which each other and the ski patrol at Spirit Mountain.<\/p>\n<p>The AED would be located in our Team Room which is located at the top of the ski hill where athletes train.  If needed the AED and current first aid kit could be deployed in seconds and arrive within minutes to the scene of the emergency.<\/p>\n<p>The AED would be the last piece of life safety equipment to make us 100% complaint. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Team Duluth Ski Club is committed to developing on-snow skills and personal growth in young athletes.
