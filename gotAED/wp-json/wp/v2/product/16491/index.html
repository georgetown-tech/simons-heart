I am the  ATC for the Powerballers, a  501(c3), youth baseball organization based out of the Lehigh Valley in PA.  We roster teams from age 12-17U and will add more teams for Fall\/Spring baseball schedule.  While we do not have a permanent facility, we operate our Winter Workouts with the teams out of two large buildings situated near each other on the grounds of our owners, the Moyzan family.  The AED would be housed in one of our buildings during the fall\/winter\/spring sessions where our teams practice, workout, and perform skill lessons with our coaching staff.  During the summer, The AED would travel with me, a certified athletic trainer (ATC), during practices and games that I attend with our various teams playing games in the Lehigh Valley, Southeastern and Central PA, Central NJ, and DE. I believe our organization would benefit from an AED because we are growing very quickly and have a lot of moving parts with various practice and game sites.  Currently, we have 75-80 growing young men that are maneuvering all over the PA\/NJ area from practices to games and the piece of mind from parents and stakeholders that an AED is present during baseball activities shows continued commitment to the health, safety, and wellbeing of an underserved athletic population.  I have held the role of organizational ATC for three years and to my knowledge, no other youth baseball organization in the area provides its members access to an ATC during practices and games and having an AED can only strengthen our commitment in the health and safety to our players.  Personally and professionally, I have been to way too many youth baseball games without access to this vital piece of emergency equipment.  We can do better for our youth sports population. We have to do better.  The Powerballers are going to be the change.  Powerballers Baseball is one that prides itself on long-term growth in ballplayers by setting expectations such as commitment, attitude, sportsmanship, and development over outcome.
