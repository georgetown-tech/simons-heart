Copper Basin High School has 300 students that are enrolled and it is 100% free and reduced lunch which shows the socioeconomic situation it is in. There are no industries or large corporations within the community and our local hospital recently closed which leaves the community with a drive to get to a hospital or emergency center. Our school is equipped with 2 AED&#8217;s. One stays in the front lobby and the other is located in field house next to the football field which is a walking distance away.<br \/>\nAfter a faculty training for CPR, we have been alarmed at the importance of having this piece of equipment in our building and having enough to fulfill any emergency. In order to be prepared for an emergency situation that would require an AED, we would like to have another AED in place in the building and possibly one to use for traveling sports teams and band members. With our school being located in such a rural and low socioeconomic area and the fact that we are a distance from an emergency facility, any donation to put AED&#8217;s in this school to prepare the Copper Basin area would be greatly appreciated. We rely on stakeholders and generous donators to help prepare our staff, students, and community to react to emergency situations. Copper Basin High School is applying for this campaign in hopes to be able to place an additional AED in the school and we would greatly appreciate any help that is given.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are a grades 7-12 high school located in the rural southeast corner of Tennessee.
