But it wasn\u2019t until my own sudden cardiac arrest experience in October 2017 that I really began to learn and understand HOW and WHY the AED is so important. The restaurant were my SCA occurred did not have an AED. Thankfully, the staff and customers jumped into action and did CPR until the paramedics arrived. I am in the very small minority of survivors.  Almost 360,000 people, of ALL ages, will have an out of hospital sudden cardiac arrest. 90% of those people will not survive. And sadly, more than 2,000 of those fatalities are student athletes. I thought about my daughter and the five years that she played volleyball. I thought about all of the girls and the coaches in her travel club. What if something had happened to one of them during practice or a tournament? In learning more about what had happened to me and trying to spread awareness about sudden cardiac arrest, I was introduced to GotAED. <\/p>\n<p>Just one year after my own sudden cardiac arrest, I held a 5K to raise money to purchase an AED for Birmingham Volleyball Club. I am very happy to be able to provide their new gym with this life saving device, just in time for the 2019 club volleyball season!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As an adult, I\u2019ve always understood the need in being CPR certified.
