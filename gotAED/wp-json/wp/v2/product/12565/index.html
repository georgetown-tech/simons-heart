I am a new school nurse, but I have been a surgical nurse for 28 years. I was invited to be the school nurse at Pace Academy, this school has only been up and running for 1 year. I was to be retired, however I could not decline since the need was urgent. The school nurse that was present was only there for the year and has resigned.<br \/>\nMy son attends this specialized charter school for Dyslexia, ADHD, and autism. This school was founded by a mother who was frustrated with the public school system. How could I decline? She is now responsible for running an entire school. I just knew I had to step in and help.  I have experienced first hand the cardiac arrest of a school teacher after a school trip. It was traumatizing not having equipment on hand to help.<br \/>\nPlease consider a donation for this amazing school. This will allow funding \/donations to go to other areas for education.
