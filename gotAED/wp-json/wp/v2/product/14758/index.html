Having an AED on hand can mean the difference between life and death for someone experiencing an SCA. With this grant, we would be able to purchase an AED that would be readily available for use in our church in case of an emergency.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to purchasing the AED, we would also provide training to our congregation on how to properly use the device. This training would give our members the confidence and skills necessary to respond effectively in an emergency situation, potentially saving lives.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone who enters our doors, and having an AED on hand and trained congregation members is a critical step in achieving that goal. With your support, we can ensure that our community is prepared to respond to any emergency situation and provide the highest level of care to those in need.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The New Life Church is a small, but thriving community that is committed to the spiritual and physical well-being of its members.
