We are a USA Lacrosse member organization serving U8 to U18 lacrosse players dedicated to teaching and growing the sport of lacrosse in the region.  Due to the high likelihood of impact of equipment and body parts, there is an increased and inherent risk of Sudden Cardiac Arrest in children participating in the sport.  Sudden cardiac death is the most common medical cause of death in athletes, with an incidence of around 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 80,000 athletes per year.  Commotio Cordis causes sudden cardiac arrest in an otherwise healthy heart after a blow to the chest area.  It\u2019s estimated that 15-25 athletes across sports die every year due to commotio cordis. Most are under the age of 18.  USA Lacrosse was the first governing body to mandate the NOCSAE standard.  USA Lacrosse now requires all goalies and field players in girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 lacrosse to wear protectors that meet the standard. Rage Lacrosse club is fully compliant with the standard, enhancing player safety and helping to prevent catastrophic injuries.  Taking safety one step further, Rage Lacrosse is seeking funding to provide an on-field AED and training for all coaching staff and parent volunteers, to provide quick treatment should a sudden cardiac emergency arise, thereby reducing the chance of death from such an emergency.  Please join us in providing the safest environment possible for our young lacrosse players and spectators.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Rage Lacrosse Club serves Washington County, Smyth County, Russell County, the City of Bristol in Virginia along with Sullivan County and the city of Bristol in Tennessee.
