Our soccer program is in it&#8217;s third year with 170 kids between the ages of 3-16 playing  this Fall. <\/p>\n<p>Did you know that sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in the United States, taking the lives of 350,000 adults every year? This is more than lung cancer, breast cancer and AIDS, combined. But, SCA is not just an adult thing. It is the leading cause of death of student athletes and takes the lives of thousands of students annually.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason, WCSA recognizes the need to have properly trained personnel in place along with an accessible AED device available at our soccer fields. The strenuous exertion of the game of soccer demands preparations be in place to deal with the unthinkable. Research shows that someone has the best chance of survival if an AED is used within the three minutes of a person collapsing. In fact, using an AED device increases the chances of survival by seventy percent. This campaign will provide an AED that will be available at all WCSA, Waynesboro Middle School, and Wayne County High School soccer games and practices. The device will be dedicated to the Sportsplex soccer fields and will always be available to anyone using the fields.<\/p>\n<p>Your donation will help our program be prepared for the most terrifying event at a sports contest. Thank you for your help.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Wayne County Soccer Association is a non-profit, volunteer based organization whose mission is to promote affordable, competitive soccer in our county and develop talented young players by helping them grow both physically and mentally to their highest potential all while encouraging sportsmanship, teamwork, respect and fair play among players of all age levels, coaches, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":5018,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"product_cat":[],"product_tag":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.2 -
