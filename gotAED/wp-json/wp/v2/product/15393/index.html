An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a portable device that can assess and if needed, restore a normal heart rhythm in such a sudden cardiac event. An AED can be effective in 90% of cases, if used in the first couple of minutes of the cardiac arrest. Time is of the essence in these situations, and having an AED on hand can make all the difference in saving a life.<br \/>\nAs most of us know, HTCC of KC is a non-profit organization located in Shawnee, Kansas. As this community continues to grow, safety of children and devotees is of utmost importance. AEDs help save lives and with your contribution, you can save lives too. AEDs in our temple are not only required by regulating agencies, but it is also the right thing to do. We can make a positive change by providing temple visitors an easy access to the critical medical equipment.<br \/>\nWe believe that this investment in the safety of the temple children and devotees is paramount. Please consider donating for this important cause. Any amount of money will help.<br \/>\nWe are collaborating with Project Adam [https:\/\/www.projectadam.com\/communitysites],  supported locally by Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital, to help HTCC avail and maintain this potentially life-saving equipment. You can donate towards this cause by clicking below.<br \/>\nWe like to thank Hindu Temple of Kansas City (HTCC) for giving us the opportunity to serve the community through this campaign.<br \/>\nThank you for your support, in advance.<br \/>\nYours Sincerely,<br \/>\nVritika Shah, Aarnee Dedhia, Nia Shah, Shriya Shah  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Community Citizens, We, who represent the youth of Kansas City, are reaching out regarding the installation of an automated external defibrillator (AED) at our Hindu Temple &#038; Cultural Center (HTCC) of Kansas City.
