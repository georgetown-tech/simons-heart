We chose to work with Simon&#8217;s Heart for our senior culminating project, where we will fundraise for an AED for St. George School in Philadelphia. <\/p>\n<p>St. George School began operating in 1910, with only two teachers and 32 students. With the construction of the present school in 1920, the addition of several lay teachers, and the arrival of the religious Sisters, enrollment began to climb to 315 pupils. The Sisters&#8217; vocation at the school lasted until 1988, when the school began with a complete lay faculty. Since the late 1990\u2019s the school experienced a growth spurt in academics. A professionally run computer program was instituted, a  new Pre-K program was established,  three new classrooms were constructed and laptop computers with internet access were installed.<\/p>\n<p>St George Independent School is a small school situated in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia. Serving the area kids for 100 years now, they focus on small class size, quality academics, faith-filled lives all in a family atmosphere. Their mission is to empower the youth of today to be GREAT- God Centered, Respectful, Enthusiastic, Attentive , and Trustworthy! They offer a STREAM curriculum with specials for Pre-K through 8th grade like Spanish, Technology, and Music. The students and families at St George not only enjoy the quality education that is offered, they also enjoy being a part of a close-knit community that looks out for one another. Many students and teachers are alumni of St. George and even our principal is a graduate of this great school!  Over the years, St. George has changed and modernized with the times and they continue to grow every day, but they have never lost focus on the importance of their mission. Through the teachings of the Catholic Church and innovative educational initiatives, they focus on striving for one&#8217;s personal best, the importance of community, and equipping leaders for the future!<\/p>\n<p>St. George School would benefit greatly from an AED because they currently do not have one. AED&#8217;s are crucial for all areas where kids learn and play, and can be used in times of sudden cardiac arrest.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our names are Rosemary Si and Katherine Hong, and we are seniors at Upper Dublin High School in Fort Washington, PA.
