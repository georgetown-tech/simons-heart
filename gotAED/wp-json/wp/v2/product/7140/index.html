This has shaken the community, and it&#8217;s a situation I never want to see repeated. This is why I have started the Javon Craddock Project.<\/p>\n<p>Tyner is blessed to have multiple AEDs on campus, but nothing that can be taken to our athletic fields for practices and games. With a response time over the recommended 3 minute window, we have 150 student-athletes here who are at risk daily. With your help, our sports medicine staff can have our own AED that can be taken to athletic events to ensure that an AED is never more than a few seconds away- leading to better outcomes for our student-athletes, officials, parents, and community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My name is Hunter Amos and I&#8217;m the athletic trainer at Tyner Academy.
