I am the son of Cece McGovern and grandson of Paul and Cecelia McGovern on the West Shore of Elk Lake in Waymart, PA. I am also a rising sophomore at Saint Joseph\u2019s University in Philadelphia. <\/p>\n<p>When I was five years old, I was diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia that put me at high risk of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA). I was lucky to stumble upon my condition, but many don\u2019t realize that they have underlying conditions until it is too late. <\/p>\n<p>For the past five years, I have worked with a non-profit called Simon\u2019s Heart to fundraise for free youth heart screenings, educate on CPR, and to place AEDs (automated external defibrillators) in schools and athletic facilities. Anyone can collapse from sudden cardiac arrest, and it is best that we as a community are prepared in case of an emergency. This crowdfunding site, GotAED, is a Simon\u2019s Heart project. All donations will go toward the AED to benefit our Elk Lake community. <\/p>\n<p>If an AED is used within the first minute of a cardiac arrest occurrence, the survival rate for victims can be as high as 90%. For every minute that defibrillation is delayed, however, the chance of survival decreases by 10% (American Heart Association). The Wayne County, PA average EMS response time is 15 minutes (PA Department of Health). Being ten miles away from the nearest hospital and having a community with young children, this AED is a necessity. <\/p>\n<p>Once funded, I will be the site coordinator of the AED, which will be stored at the Community Pavilion on the West Shore. In case of an emergency, come to the pavilion by foot, golf cart, car, or boat. I recognize the need for more AEDs around the lake, but this location, as a public space, is an easy starting place that can still benefit Elk Lakers from every shore. <\/p>\n<p>I will also have a CPR and AED demo for any Elk Lakers interested in learning the proper Chain of Survival. <\/p>\n<p>Donate Here: \u200b\u200bhttps:\/\/shorturl.at\/isMWX<\/p>\n<p>Nota bene<\/p>\n<p>AEDs cannot be stored at temperatures less than 32\u00b0F. Due to accessibility laws around AEDs, it must be stored in a location that is public and accessible to all (not in a locked building). Therefore, the AED will be stored off-site from mid-October through mid-April annually.<\/p>\n<p>42 PA CSA \u00a7 8331-8338  THE GOOD SAMARITAN AND RELATED ACTS<br \/>\nProvides complete protection of individuals who try to assist during a medical emergency from civil and criminal charges.
