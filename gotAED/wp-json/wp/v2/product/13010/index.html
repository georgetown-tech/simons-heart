We have the privilege of watching our athletes develop on the soccer pitch, in the classroom, and in life. With this privilege, also comes the responsibility to protect young HEARTS. On any given weekend, we have over 50 games and attract between 2,000 to 5,000 spectators from throughout our community. We believe it is vital to protect the HEARTS of not only our players but also those who provide them love and support.<br \/>\nWe hope to provide AEDs at 8 of our fields. Our goal is to protect the HEART of every child and spectator. Additionally, we hope to partner with our local school district and townships to house many of our AEDs in places accessible to the local community on a 24\/7 basis. We are a community first and foremost, and truly care about the HEARTS of our community. Our AEDs can hopefully protect them as well. Thank you so much for supporting our goal to protect HEARTS.  Thank you for helping us to provide a safe environment for soccer in the HEART of the Colonial Soccer Club community.     <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Colonial Soccer Club serves over 1,000 children Pre-K through 12th grade in Montgomery County.
