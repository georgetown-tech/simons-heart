All municipal or county recreation departments, nonprofit youth-serving organizations and youth camps must also have an AED accessible to athletic events and practices with at least one umpire, coach, counselor or staff member trained in CPR and use of an AED. A state-certified emergency services provider or other first responder could fulfill this requirement.<\/p>\n<p>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/njtoday.net\/2012\/01\/23\/senate-committee-advances-bill-to-protect-child-athletes-from-sudden-cardiac-arrest\/#ixzz1nA6HkmrD\">http:\/\/njtoday.net\/2012\/01\/23\/senate-committee-advances-bill-to-protect-child-athletes-from-sudden-cardiac-arrest\/#ixzz1nA6HkmrD<\/a><br \/>\nTell everyone to get New Jersey News from WWW.NJTODAY.NET<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TRENTON \u2013 Legislation sponsored by Senator Joseph F.
