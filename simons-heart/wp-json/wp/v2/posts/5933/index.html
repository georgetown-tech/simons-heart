2012.\u00a0 To put another way, 0.7 people died each year from lightning.\u00a0 By the way, all seven were adults.<\/p>\n<p>This debate isn\u2019t about Michigan though.\u00a0 It is about the United States and this number doesn\u2019t take into account states like Florida and Texas that have many more lightning deaths.<\/p>\n<p>The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aap.org\/en-us\/about-the-aap\/aap-press-room\/pages\/Understanding-Pediatric-Sudden-Cardiac-Arrest.aspx\">2,000 children<\/a> die in the U.S. every year from sudden cardiac arrest.\u00a0 When extrapolated over a fifty-three year period, this number is 106,000.<\/p>\n<p>During this same period (1959 \u2013 2012), the NOAA recorded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov\/stats\/59-12_State_Ltg._Fatality_Map-rates.pdf\">4,002 deaths<\/a> from lightning strikes, and the overwhelming majority of the deaths were adults.<\/p>\n<p>The conditions that cause our children to drop dead are detectable and treatable.\u00a0 We have a cure . . . it\u2019s called prevention.\u00a0 While it is tragic to read about the deaths of Wes, Nicholas, Ryan and Mario, the real tragedy lies within a very well respected segment of the medical community that confuses and misguides the public about the incidents of sudden cardiac arrest and death in children.\u00a0 If we can\u2019t rely on them to help us define the scope of the problem, we\u2019ll never solve the problem, and we\u2019ll continue to bury children like Ryan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I grew up in Ohio.
