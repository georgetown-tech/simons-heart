Based on the data we&#8217;ve gathered from our heart screenings, and the data shared by other organizations, cardiac screenings of our youth saves lives.\u00a0 They are accurate and affordable.<\/p>\n<p>You may be surprised, however, to hear us say, &#8220;don&#8217;t take our word for it.&#8221; We want science to settle this debate and we know that this requires data and proof.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s our proposal. We&#8217;ll raise the money. We&#8217;ll review all of the cardiology conference agendas from the last two years and invite the debaters to participate in a study. Yes, the biggest opponents and staunchest proponents side by side. Maybe we&#8217;ll make it a reality TV show too.<\/p>\n<p>They will collectively decide on how many students are needed for the sample, and they&#8217;ll screen kids, together. \u00a0That&#8217;s right, Dr. No Screening will sit right beside Dr. Mandatory Screening and review the results.<\/p>\n<p>There will be no retrospective analyses, Google searches or foreign studies. \u00a0We&#8217;re going to put electrodes on students in this country and see how this plays out. \u00a0We\u2019ll do complete physicals, medical histories and EKG exams on all of the students.\u00a0 We\u2019ll do echos on some.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, one hypothesis will prevail, but we can settle the debate using science and patient research.<\/p>\n<p>Are you in? \u00a0It may force you to get down from your soapbox and\/or cut down on your presentations. \u00a0It may force conference planners to conjure up other controversial topics. \u00a0It may even save some lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last Friday, I spent one day at two conferences about sudden cardiac arrest and death in the young.\u00a0 The SADS Foundation (www.sads.org)
