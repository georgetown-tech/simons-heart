For years, little was known about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS. Babies would die in their sleep, and it was presumed that little could be done to prevent those deaths.<\/p>\n<p>Today in the U.S., more than 2,000 babies die of SIDS every year, according to government figures.<\/p>\n<p>But the mystery surrounding SIDS is not what it once was. Many SIDS deaths are now believed to be accidents caused by unsafe sleep practices. And some are questioning whether the term SIDS remains relevant at all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SIDS: A &#8216;Diagnosis Of Exclusion&#8217;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In Wayne County, Mich., 50 to 60 infants die suddenly and unexpectedly each year, most of them in Detroit.<\/p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, the task of investigating those cases has fallen to Pat Tackitt, a pediatric mortality investigator for the Wayne County Medical Examiner&#8217;s Office.<\/p>\n<p>When an infant dies, law enforcement will contact her. She&#8217;ll head out immediately to the family&#8217;s home, spending anywhere from one to five hours talking with the family, using a doll to help parents re-enact what happened.<\/p>\n<p><a
