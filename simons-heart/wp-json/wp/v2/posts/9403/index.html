It is the leading cause of death of adults in this country. However, it is not just an adult thing. It is linked\u00a0to\u00a010% of SIDS deaths; is the leading cause of death of student athletes; and takes the lives of thousands of children\u00a0every year.<\/p>\n<p>Is it contagious?<\/p>\n<p>Last week, two\u00a0stories broke about the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in athletes.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/default.salsalabs.org\/T7b4e93da-f726-4210-8658-d766c99c2d60\/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cameron Smith<\/a>, a twenty-four year old\u00a0linebacker with\u00a0the Minnesota Vikings, discovered a heart condition (bicuspid aortic valve) after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Biscupid aortic valve is a condition where the aortic valve has two leaflets instead of three.\u00a0The aortic valve regulates blood flow from heart to the aorta. This is a structural heart condition and\u00a0is usually inherited.<\/p>\n<p>Then, the <a href=\"https:\/\/default.salsalabs.org\/Tea5fc6e9-4348-46c4-8761-209c7c9ca843\/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Big Ten reported<\/a> at least\u00a0ten players were diagnosed with myocarditis after testing positive for COVID-19. Myocarditis is\u00a0an\u00a0inflammation of the heart muscle (called myocardium) that limits the heart&#8217;s ability to pump blood. This condition is also structural, but it is acquired. It is caused by things like a virus or a drug interaction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that COVID-19 can attack the heart, said David Shipon, a cardiologist at Jefferson University Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of Simon&#8217;s Heart. &#8220;Typically, the worse the symptoms are from\u00a0COVID, the greater the likelihood that the heart will become inflamed. But,\u00a0all physically active individuals who are diagnosed with COVID should get their hearts screened because we are still learning about the effects of this virus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These stories amplify our message &#8211;\u00a0testing and screening are so important. It\u00a0is not enough for us to assume that Cameron&#8217;s\u00a0heart was healthy for the first two decades of his life. He and all of his high school classmates should have been screened. He\u00a0is\u00a0an elite athlete. He won a state championship in high school, played at USC for four years, and was drafted by the NFL. Should he have to wait for a pandemic to find\u00a0something so significant?<\/p>\n<p>The case of the Big Ten players underscores the importance\u00a0of screening for a different reason. It is not enough to report\u00a0positive tests, hospitalizations and fatalities of COVID-19. We need to understand how\u00a0this virus is compromising the hearts and other\u00a0parts of our children. Over <a href=\"https:\/\/default.salsalabs.org\/T39fefe37-5b25-41b0-83cd-e8f24d98b515\/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">300,000<\/a> children have tested positive for coronavirus, and while the mortality rate is very low today, how many of these children will suffer from heart failure or cardiac arrest in the future? We won&#8217;t know unless we screen and conduct research.<\/p>\n<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is not contagious, although viruses like COVID-19 that can cause myocarditis are. Whether the conditions are inherited or acquired, we\u00a0can prevent sudden cardiac arrest through screening and research.\u00a0Our children don&#8217;t have to die from detectable and treatable heart conditions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is what happens when the heart stops beating suddenly and unexpectedly.
