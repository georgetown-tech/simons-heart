Remember how much buzz that book created! However, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s about the success that Simon&#8217;s Fund has experienced as a result of tapping into a student village.<\/p>\n<p>For years now, Simon&#8217;s Fund has depended on high school groups, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhs.us\">National Honor Society<\/a>, to help out at our heart screenings. These students have been amazing &#8211; prompt, courteous and mature. We&#8217;ve always valued the fact that students could helping us protect the hearts of other students. It is a very meaningful ingredient of our work.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, we have discovered other ways for students to contribute to our mission. Medical students from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jefferson.edu\/jmc.html\">Jefferson<\/a> took vitals at our screenings. A graduate student from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fels.upenn.edu\">Fels School of Government at Penn<\/a>, helped us reach out to lawmakers across the country about the <a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/protect-this-heart\/sudden-cardiac-arrest\/\">Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act<\/a>. Last weekend, six Physician Assistant (PA) students at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arcadia.edu\/academic\/default.aspx?id=425\">Arcadia University<\/a> were trained how to administer EKG exams on students. Two students from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.haverford.edu\">Haverford College<\/a> created an app for us to use during our heart screenings to collect data. This summer, students at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lebow.drexel.edu\/academics\/departments\/marketing\">Drexel University<\/a> will develop a Simon&#8217;s Fund specific cause-related marketing campaign for eight different corporations as part of their marketing course.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, Simon&#8217;s Fund greatly benefits from this arrangement. We don&#8217;t have a big staff, nor do we want one. This allows us to have more balls in the air and accomplish more of our objectives. But here&#8217;s what I really value about these relationships.<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest conclusions I drew from my years in school &#8211; high school, college and law school &#8211; was that the coursework did not prepare me for a job. I used to always wonder &#8220;when am I going to use this.&#8221; The students that work with Simon&#8217;s Fund don&#8217;t have to wonder. Chris may help pass a law while getting his Masters. Stephanie would have never learned how to do EKGs on kids in her program. Ivan knows how to develop an app for a company. A marketing student may pitch and help launch a cause-related marketing campaign. This is priceless for both parties, particularly to those students whose lives will be saved as a result.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This post would probably get more hits if it either praised or criticized Hillary&#8217;s book, It Takes a Village.
