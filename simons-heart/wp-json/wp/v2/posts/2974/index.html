Strong and fit, August showed no symptoms. But doctors said he died from an inherited disorder &#8212; a thickening of the heart muscle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You worry about drugs, you worry about alcohol, you worry about car wrecks,\u201d says Koontz. \u201cNot once did we ever think of my son dying from natural causes, from a heart condition.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These disorders are hard to pick up from a physical examination and don&#8217;t necessarily impair a student&#8217;s athletic abilities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But make them vulnerable to developing very serious rhythm problems when they get that surge of adrenaline when they&#8217;re participating in sports,&#8221; says Dr. Rodgers.<\/p>\n<p>About one out of every 180 students is as at high-risk for sudden cardiac death. But these conditions are very easy to pick up with an electrocardiogram, which traces the heart &#8212; or with an ultrasound of the heart. Thanks to newly founded AugustHeart Foundation, both tools are being used on these students. Both give immediate results.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/foxsanantonio.com\/newsroom\/top_stories\/videos\/vid_7096.shtml\">FULL STORY AND VIDEO<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>KABB Fox San Antonio &#8211; August 14, 2011 One family hopes its heartbreak can prevent others from losing an active teen to sudden cardiac death.
