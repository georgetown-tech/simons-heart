to Sycamore"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>The Sycamore school board recently declined an offer from Simon&#8217;s Fund to pay for and organize a heart screening for the students in the District.\u00a0 The board said that (1) they cannot support mass heart screenings because of the American Heart Association; and (2) that this is a matter for parents and their pediatricians.\u00a0\u00a0Below is our response.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for having several conversations with the board, and for considering this free heart screening.\u00a0 I appreciate the gratitude expressed by the board.\u00a0 However, I need to share a few thoughts.\u00a0 I hope that you will accept my passion and conviction.<\/p>\n<p>This is the first time that a school district has rejected a free heart screening, so I am really at a loss for words.\u00a0 I am also numb and nauseous.\u00a0 It is a feeling similar to the feeling that consumed me in the days following Simon\u2019s death.\u00a0 It is the feeling that I felt after learning about Jose\u2019s death.\u00a0I think that the board\u2019s reasoning is seriously flawed.<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The AHA and ACC do not recommend mass screenings for two primary reasons \u2013 the concern about who will read the reports, which leads into a discussion on false-positives, and the expense of screening all students across the United States.\u00a0 These concerns do not apply to the screening at Sycamore.\u00a0 First,\u00a0 expense is not an issue because Simon\u2019s Fund is paying for this screening.\u00a0 Second, false-positives are always an issue in medicine, whether it is a heart screening or hearing and eye exam.\u00a0 However, when a heart screening is conducted using an ECG machine and an echocardiogram, and the tests are read by trained pediatric electrophysiologists from Children\u2019s Hospital, the risk of false-positives is drastically reduced.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.radiologyinfo.org\/en\/info.cfm?pg=mammo\">American College of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America<\/a>, 5 \u2013 15% of all mammograms yield a false-positive result.\u00a0Despite this, \u00a0I\u2019m fairly confident that all of the age-appropriate females working for the District have received a mammogram.\u00a0 Simply put, the existence of false-positives does not deter us from using non-invasive diagnostic tests that save lives.\u00a0 Therefore, while there is a healthy debate about the feasibility of mass screenings in the United States, the AHA and ACC concerns do not apply here.<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/family-health\/heart\/articles\/2011\/03\/22\/screening-seems-to-catch-dangerous-heart-condition-in-kids\">study conducted by the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia<\/a>, heart screenings find undetected and potentially-fatal heart conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 You won\u2019t find a study to refute that.\u00a0 In fact, an ECG exam can detect 80% of the conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest.\u00a0 Simon\u2019s Fund has provided 2,100 free hearts screenings.\u00a0 As a result, 20 students discovered potentially-fatal heart conditions.\u00a0 If you want to meet two of them, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZCJ4vaNnZLQ&feature=player_embedded\">watch this video<\/a>.\u00a0 This means that 1 out of every 100 students has an undetected heart condition.\u00a0\u00a0 This statistic is consistent with data from other organizations that provide free heart screenings \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/health.usnews.com\/health-news\/family-health\/heart\/articles\/2011\/03\/22\/screening-seems-to-catch-dangerous-heart-condition-in-kids\">Young Hearts for Life<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/my.sycamoreschools.org\/modules\/_305_1\/Sticks%20and%20Stones%20program.pdf\">Save a Life Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxandthewildthings.com\/\">The Max Schewitz Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.quinndriscollfoundation.org\/\">The Quinn Driscoll Foundation<\/a>, and others.<\/p>\n<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is the number one killer of young athletes.\u00a0 At Sycamore, Jose was 1 in 100.\u00a0 In a student body of 1900, who are the other 18 kids?<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There are many matters traditionally reserved for the parent-pediatrician or parent-student relationship.\u00a0 However, that hasn\u2019t stopped Sycamore from inserting itself and offering public service or public safety programs for the student body.\u00a0 Over the past couple of years, the district has offered a <a href=\"http:\/\/my.sycamoreschools.org\/modules\/_305_1\/Sticks%20and%20Stones%20program.pdf\">program on cyber-bullying<\/a> and encouraged students to get <a href=\"http:\/\/my.sycamoreschools.org\/webContent\/welcome\/news\/H1N1%20Packet%20%20rev%2010-6-09.pdf\">vaccinated for the flu<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u2019m not sure how the board can reconcile an endorsement of flu vaccinations with a rejection of a screening for sudden cardiac arrest and death.\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t believe there is a way to reconcile them.\u00a0 Sycamore lost a student to sudden cardiac arrest; it did not lose a student to the flu.\u00a0 Pediatricians offer and insurance pays for vaccinations; heart screenings are not provided nor covered by insurance.\u00a0 \u00a0The sad truth is that most parents and pediatricians don\u2019t know about the warning signs or the conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest, so to leave it up to them and hope for the best is careless.\u00a0 I am sure Jose was examined by a pediatrician several times during his life.\u00a0 He probably underwent some pre-participation exams too.\u00a0 In hindsight, which sanctioned program helped Jose more \u2013 cyber-bullying or the flu vaccine?<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m incredibly disappointed with my former school district.\u00a0 After Simon died, Phyllis and I decided to dedicate part of our lives to ensure that this senseless and preventable tragedy doesn\u2019t strike another family.\u00a0 We spend countless personal hours and dollars for this selfless mission.\u00a0 This consumes time that we would normally spend with our other children.\u00a0 \u00a0This is time that we don\u2019t have for friends and fun.<\/p>\n<p>I can\u2019t believe that Sycamore is obstructing my ability to provide this free service. \u00a0It shocks my conscience that a group of committed parents serving on the school board will not avail themselves of every opportunity to educate and protect the student body from dangers, particularly when they can result in sudden death.\u00a0 How many more Sycamore families will have to experience this tragedy before the school board is willing to (1) provide a space; and (2) send out a letter to the parents in the district?\u00a0 Is that really too much to ask?<\/p>\n<p>While I hope that the board reconsiders its decision, we are not going to wait for it do so.\u00a0 We will bring this screening to the students of my hometown by working with the Cerda family, friends and former students.\u00a0 We will step in and fill the leadership void left by the school board.\u00a0 We will take it upon ourselves to check hearts and save lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Sycamore school board recently declined an offer from
