Phyllis Sudman has long credited her child, Simon, with saving her life. Following his death, the family was instructed to get their hearts checked. Through this process, Phyllis was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, and a reason for Simon\u2019s death was found. The Jones family credits the Sudmans and Simons Fund with saving both mom Rayna\u2019s and daughter Whitney\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In May 2012, Whitney\u2019s cheerleading coach signed her entire team up for Simon\u2019s Fund\u2019s free heart screening at Downingtown West High School. Before the screening, neither Whitney, a competitive cheerleader, nor Rayna, a former runner and swimmer, knew much about sudden cardiac arrest among students. They certainly had not heard of Long QT Syndrome, a hereditary heart condition particularly dangerous for athletes. Within a month, both would be diagnosed with the condition that killed Simon Sudman.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cWe really admire how the Sudmans have given back to so many others by organizing Simon&#8217;s Fund to help others avoid the same tragedy faced by their family.\u00a0For the rest of our lives, we will be thankful for their mission to help others. It is hard to find the words to express our heartfelt appreciation for what they have done for our family,\u201d says Rayna Jones.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Rayna remembers sitting at the screening waiting \u2026 and waiting, as her daughter\u2019s friends were being sent home, until the cardiologist came out and asked to speak with her privately. They\u2019d found an anomaly on Whitney\u2019s EKG and wanted to do an echocardiogram on site. The findings were not conclusive, but suggested Long QT Syndrome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Getting a final diagnosis took the family almost a year of additional testing, because Whitney\u2019s results were borderline. One test was particularly memorable. Whitney underwent a stress test at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Her heart reacted intensely to the test, and for the first time, the family became frightened. Yet the diagnosis was still not definitive, so the doctors suggested genetic testing. That\u2019s where the Jones finally got their answers. Both Whitney and Rayna had the hereditary heart condition; Rayna\u2019s was much more severe than her daughter\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Joneses are grateful that their insurance covered this testing, allowing them to finally get the answer they needed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whitney is lucky; her sport of choice centers around a two and a half minute routine. Sports like soccer or basketball with sustained activity could prove too dangerous. Still Whitney\u2019s doctor requires that an AED be available on the field whenever she practices or competes. Rayna is allowed to walk for exercise, as long as she stays hydrated.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cWhitney is such a special girl with a sunny, winning spirit\u201d says her mother.\u00a0\u201cAlthough this diagnosis has been a heartbreaking experience for us, we are not going to let it rob\u00a0us of\u00a0a full life.\u00a0We are focused on managing Whitney\u2019s Long QT through medication, hydration, nutrition and avoiding the potential triggers.\u00a0In the future, we hope to help others through our story and we will be life long supporters of Simon&#8217;s Fund to help others benefit from the testing that helped our family.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Any mother would gladly lay down her life for her child, which makes both the Jones\u2019 and Sudman\u2019s stories heartbreakingly ironic.
