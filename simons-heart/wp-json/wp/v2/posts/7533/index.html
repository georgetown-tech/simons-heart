It is my 44th. For thirty-one years, the day was dedicated to honoring my mother.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>In my 32nd year, we welcomed Sally, our first child. Whoa did Mother\u2019s Day change! It became so much more special and relevant because I finally knew what it meant to be a mother. With that first sleepless night and diaper change, appreciation for my mother went through the roof.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>In my 34th year, it changed again. Simon was born. Ninety-six days later he died. He was a seemingly health three-month old. However, he had an unknown heart condition. After he died, I was diagnosed with the same condition.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Now, eleven years later, I still have a hard time articulating what his death did to my Mother\u2019s Day. I don\u2019t know how to approach it. I have two beautiful kids, and my mom lives fifteen minutes down the road. There is so much to celebrate and appreciate. But&#8230;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Most girls have thought about becoming a mother. From what I\u2019ve read, the majority of women who experience it claim that it is the most challenging and rewarding part of life. It is a role for which we are completely unprepared. Somehow, we manage.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>As I struggle to process my emotions for yet another Mother\u2019s Day season, I want to share some quotes about motherhood. Some are profound. Others are endearing. You\u2019ll recognize a few of the names. You know, the celebrities. It\u2019s fun to see how famous people view motherhood.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>However, pay closer attention to the quotes from the other women. These are women I got to know after Simon died through a group called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.parentheartwatch.org\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:0}}\">Parent Heart Watch<\/a>. Like me, they lost children to unknown heart conditions and founded organizations to spare other families from tragedy.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Like me, they struggle to make sense of this holiday, and well, a world where you can lose your child to a detectable and treatable heart condition.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Motherhood is tough. If you just want a wonderful little creature to love, you can get a puppy.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainyquote.com\/quotes\/quotes\/b\/barbarawal596036.html\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:1}}\">Barbara Walters<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Motherhood has completely changed me. It\u2019s just about like the most completely humbling experience that I\u2019ve ever had. I think that it puts you in your place because it really forces you to address the issues that you claim to believe in and if you can\u2019t stand up to those principles when you\u2019re raising a child, forget it.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.brainyquote.com\/quotes\/quotes\/d\/dianekeato429714.html\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2}}\">Diane Keaton<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>The natural state of motherhood is unselfishness. When you become a mother, you are no longer the center of your own universe.

I\u2019ve gone from one extreme of incredible pride, an abundance of love and immeasurable joy&#8230;to the unthinkable edge of despair and knock-the-wind-out-of-you total devastation after losing my precious 19 year old daughter without warning. At the best moments before my tragic loss, I remember having the feeling that my heart would burst with love and joy. And now, it\u2019s as though my heart has been completely shattered and I\u2019m not sure if the pieces can ever be reassembled.<a href=\"http:\/\/www.peytonwalker.org\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4}}\"><br \/>\nJulie Walker, The Peyton Walker Foundation<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Each of my children carry a piece of my heart but it broke into more pieces than it was made of, when my son died.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/nickoftimefoundation.org\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:5}}\">Darla Varrenti, Nick of Time Foundation<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Being a mother: There is no greater gift, nor bigger heartache.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/ryanlopynski.org\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:6}}\">Jeremy Lopynski, Ryan Lopynski Big Heart Foundation<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Motherhood is a life-long promise from you to your child.
