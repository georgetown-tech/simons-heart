These are the questions that I expected to be grappling with on a day like today &#8211; Simon&#8217;s birthday. \u00a0For me, and I can only speak for me on a topic like this, I don&#8217;t struggle with these questions anymore. \u00a0I still struggle with the picture of Simon smiling on January 8, 2005. \u00a0That&#8217;s my only point of reference. \u00a0As every year goes by, I can only go back to that picture. \u00a0A picture of baby. \u00a0It is a stark reminder that time stopped suddenly and early &#8211; way too early.<\/p>\n<p>So, back to my original question . . . Today, we are launching a new website for Simon&#8217;s Fund. \u00a0I know that a seven year old boy is probably not getting very excited about a new website (unless there is some kind of fighting or competition going on). \u00a0However, we are. \u00a0We&#8217;re excited to provide a great resource for parents and coaches so they can protect kids from sudden cardiac arrest. \u00a0We&#8217;re excited to share stories from some of the kids that we&#8217;ve helped. \u00a0We&#8217;re excited to promote the sale of unique heart-themed items that raise money for heart screenings and other life-saving initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the traditional way to celebrate a child&#8217;s birthday. \u00a0It&#8217;s not the ideal gift. \u00a0However, for us, it&#8217;s special because on his seventh birthday, Simon is giving a gift to all of us. \u00a0And every day hereafter, he&#8217;ll continue to lead the way for us to check hearts and save lives.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do you get a seven year old boy for his birthday? \u00a0Where do you have the party? \u00a0Who do you invite?
