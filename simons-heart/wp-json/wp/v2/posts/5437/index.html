As the day wore on, Karen learned that space had opened up at the \u2018sold out\u2019 screening and she went home to pick up her children to be screened. Like most parents who bring their children to screenings, Karen expected to be in and out. Like 1% of these parents \u2013 or 1 in 100 \u2013 Karen was stunned when she learned that her daughter had a heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>The EKG had shown that daughter Katie, 14, had Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome (WPW), a disorder that can run in families. Although Katie had never complained of any symptoms, such as dizziness or a racing heart, during a stress test, when her heart was stressed to a rate of 190, the Wolff Parkinson White still showed up on the monitors. This indicated that the condition could put Katie in danger. Ironically, at the time, some of Karen\u2019s days were being spent working in Abington\u2019s cardiac stress lab giving stress tests.<\/p>\n<p>People with WPW have an extra electrical circuit in their heart, which can cause their heart rate to go too high. The gravity of a person\u2019s WPW depends on which pathway is affected by the aberrant circuit. Katie\u2019s doctors could not determine which pathway was impacted without performing invasive electrophysiological tests. Her mother found this untenable, \u201cI was having a hard time intervening with an invasive procedure when Katie was not symptomatic,\u201d she explains.<\/p>\n<p>The uncertainty was taking its toll on Katie, causing her to visit the nurse more at school and feel apprehensive. Karen found herself regularly quizzing the cardiologists in her stress test lab, until finally she got the advice that spurred her to action. Dr. Andy Fireman advised her to stop thinking like a nurse and instead think like a mom about how she would feel if something happened to Katie. His advice, combined with Katie\u2019s upcoming mission to Belize, where she wouldn\u2019t have access to advanced medical care, finally made the decision easy.<\/p>\n<p>Almost nine months to the day after her initial heart screening, Katie underwent the testing and a cardiac ablation at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Her family was told after the procedure that they had made the right choice; had the doctor have known in advance which pathway was aberrant, ablation to remedy it would definitely have been recommended. An EKG and echocardiogram shortly thereafter showed no sign of WPW.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Karen Asper, a nurse affiliated with Abington Hospital, volunteered to work at Simon\u2019s Fund\u2019s free heart screening at Upper Dublin high school on September 23rd, 2012.
