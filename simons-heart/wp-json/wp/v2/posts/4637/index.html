Demand for the screening was so high in this\u00a0community, which has lost two student basketball players and a high school coach to SCA in the last 18\u00a0months, that two hours after registration opened, the event filled up \u2013 there are now over 300 people on a\u00a0waiting list.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Screening<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When: Sunday, April 7, 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Where: The Cardiovascular Group, 755 Walther Road, Lawrenceville, GA<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saving Lives to Honor Fallen Children<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The heart screening is sponsored by Simon\u2019s Fund, a Philadelphia based organization that has screened 5,500\u00a0students; 49 have discovered heart conditions. The John Stewart Foundation, based in Indiana, will be\u00a0participating in the screening as well. John was a high school basketball standout who died of SCA during a\u00a0March Madness basketball tournament in 1999, just days after being recruited by Tubby Smith for the\u00a0University of Kentucky Wildcats. At 7\u20192\u201d, John Stewart was most certainly on a road to the Final Four.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, in a suburb of Atlanta, Buford High School junior, Adam Smith, and Buford Junior High School\u00a0student, Jeremy Nelson, died from SCA. They were both basketball standouts. Both may have been on the road\u00a0to the Final Four.<\/p>\n<p>SCA ended their journeys, as well as the journeys of two thousand other students who died last year from SCA,\u00a0according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.<\/p>\n<p>SCA is the #1 medical cause of death in the NCAA. Recently, Utah State&#8217;s Danny Berger collapsed from an\u00a0undetected heart condition, and Utah\u2019s Star Lotulelei was diagnosed with a heart condition at the NFL\u00a0Combine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking Up to Prevent a Silent Killer<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is an often-silent killer, whose symptoms \u2013 shortness of breath and fainting to name a few\u00a0\u2013 are easily confused by students, parents and coaches with signs of dehydration or exhaustion. An ECG exam\u00a0can detect up to 80 percent of the conditions that cause sudden cardiac arrest. An ECG exam, coupled with a\u00a0physical and medical history, is the most effective way to prevent sudden cardiac death in student athletes\u00a0according to a study in the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (2012).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs coaches, we spend so much time preparing our players, because we don\u2019t we don\u2019t to lose a game. We need\u00a0to focus on sudden cardiac arrest, because losing a student athlete is much worse,\u201d said Phil Martelli, men\u2019s\u00a0basketball coach of the St. Joseph\u2019s University Hawks and first vice president of the National Association of\u00a0Basketball coaches, which is meeting in Atlanta during the Final Four.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our 1 Percent: 1 in 100 Students Has Undetected Heart Condition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the screening, every student will complete a medical history, have vital signs checked, and receive an ECG \u2013\u00a0a painless, non-invasive test that takes a couple of minutes. Cardiologists from The Cardiovascular Group,\u00a0Children\u2019s Cardiovascular Medicine and Pediatric Cardiology Services will review all of the information and\u00a0determine whether the students need to get an echocardiogram, also available at the screening.<\/p>\n<p>Darren and Phyllis Sudman founded Simon\u2019s Fund in 2005 after their seemingly healthy 14-week old son,\u00a0Simon, died from sudden cardiac arrest during his nap. One in every 100 children screened by Simon\u2019s Fund\u00a0and its brethren organizations nationwide is found to have a heart condition. These are the same conditions\u00a0diagnosed regularly in pro basketball players, during their mandated heart screenings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt birth, we screen our children for rare genetic conditions. In elementary school, we screen their eyes and\u00a0ears. How is it that we ignore their hearts, the most important organ in their bodies, when we know that\u00a0thousands die every year,\u201d says Darren Sudman, Executive Director of Simon\u2019s Fund and Simon\u2019s dad.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Simon\u2019s Fund<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In addition to providing heart screenings, Simon\u2019s Fund advocates for legislation to protect student athletes\u00a0from sudden cardiac arrest. The organization is behind the first such legislation in the country, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u00a0Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act. Since its passage in May of last year, Simon\u2019s Fund has worked with\u00a0five more states to introduce similar legislation, including Indiana, home of the NCAA.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Download Press Release Atlanta \u2013 (February 11, 2013) \u2013 Less than an hour from the Georgia Dome, the day before the NCAA\u00a0Championship Game, over 300 students will be screened for potentially fatal heart conditions that cause sudden\u00a0cardiac arrest (SCA) and death, the #1 killer of student athletes.
