The Fund could have been about SIDS because Simon died when he was three months. However, we did lots of research and tests, which led us to the real cause of death &#8211; Long QT Syndrome. \u00a0LQTS is responsible for up to 15% of all SIDS deaths (it&#8217;s not just bumpers and back sleeping). \u00a0I guess all of the times I annoyed my teachers by asking &#8220;why&#8221; paid off. \u00a0Simon&#8217;s Fund is now an organization to raise awareness about sudden cardiac arrest in children, primarily through free heart screenings for students.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>In 2010, Jose Cerda, a junior at Sycamore was swimming for the Aviators. \u00a0He collapsed poolside and died. \u00a0The circumstances surrounding his death are textbook sudden cardiac arrest &#8211; a sudden and unexplained collapse immediately after competition. \u00a0I reached out to Jose&#8217;s mother, Luisa, and we decided to bring a heart screening to the students at Sycamore.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I reached out the school board, like I always do, for its support. \u00a0We needed a location and wanted to promote the screening to the students. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/blog\/response-to-sycamore\/\">They declined<\/a>. Fortunately, we had found strong partners in Cincinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital, Suburban Pediatrics and the Sycamore swimming community. \u00a0Working with all the organizations, we promoted the screening and held it at the Mason campus of Cincinnati Children&#8217;s.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>Matthew Green was one of the eighty-five students that attended the that screening that day. \u00a0He was a student at Sycamore High School. \u00a0Matthew discovered a hole in his heart. \u00a0It has been repaired and he has returned to basketball and diving. \u00a0Cincinnati Children&#8217;s also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/news\/20120710\/10760\/sudden-death-athlete-heart-ekg-echo.htm\">launched a study<\/a> about the best ways to conduct heart screenings for students.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I don&#8217;t know much about Jose Cerda or Matthew Green. I hope that some day I will know more. However, I know that our lives will be forever connected. For we all have lessons and experiences that we gather during our lifetime. If we learn from them, we are usually better off. \u00a0But, something truly magical happens when we share our lessons and experience for the benefit of another. That&#8217;s what makes life meaningful. That&#8217;s the Tale of Three Kiddies.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We just added another student to\u00a0Simon&#8217;s Club, the Kids&#8217; Stories section of our website. \u00a0It got me thinking . . . .
