According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, it takes the lives of 2,000 students every year.\u00a0 By many accounts, this number is low because we don\u2019t track the causes of death of children in this country.<\/p>\n<p>The sudden death of Hank Gathers 23 years ago is always mentioned when discussing the topic of sudden cardiac arrest, but we don\u2019t need to look beyond this season, or even this year\u2019s tournament to recognize the tragic impact that sudden cardiac arrest is having on our sport and our young athletes.<\/p>\n<p>Coach Fred Hoiberg led the Iowa State Cyclones into the Round of 32.\u00a0 He retired from the NBA seven years ago after discovering a heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>Creighton University advanced into the Round of 32 without their guard, Josh Jones.\u00a0 He retired from basketball earlier this year after undergoing a procedure to correct a heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>Carl Hall, a starting forward for Wichita State, retired from basketball in 2009 due to a heart condition.\u00a0 With medication, he has returned and is leading the Shockers to their first Final Four since 1965.\u00a0 Guy Alang-Ntang, also a Shocker, was not as lucky.\u00a0 He was recruited to play for the Shockers in 2007.\u00a0 During an exhibition game, he collapsed and died.\u00a0 Coach Gregg Marshall was in the stands the night he collapsed.<\/p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/04\/05\/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.004622.abstract\">recent study<\/a> published by the American Heart Association shows that 1 out of every 3,100 NCAA Division I male basketball players is at risk of dying from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) every year.\u00a0 This year, it was Nathaniel Joshua \u201cErv\u201d Ervin.\u00a0 He collapsed and died during a basketball game at Mars Hill College.\u00a0 It could have also been Danny Berger, a forward at Utah State University, who collapsed as well.\u00a0 Fortunately for Berger, an AED device was able to shock his heart and save his life.<\/p>\n<p>Is it acceptable that every year at least one NCAA basketball player will die from a detectable and preventable condition?\u00a0 Josh Jones and Carl Jones had symptoms.\u00a0 As such, they got their hearts checked.\u00a0 Nathaniel Ervin and Danny Berger didn\u2019t report any symptoms \u2013 their hearts did not get checked.<\/p>\n<p>Checking the hearts of our student athletes makes sense.\u00a0 In Italy, all of their student athletes get their hearts checked.\u00a0 This practice reduced the incidence of sudden cardiac death there by 89 percent.\u00a0 The NBA was the first professional league to institute mandatory heart screenings for its players.\u00a0 Fred Hoiberg is just one of the many beneficiaries of this policy.\u00a0 Last year, it was Jeff Green (Celtics) and LeMarcus Aldrige (Trailblazers).<\/p>\n<p>A study published in the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine establishes that an ECG exam, coupled with a physical and complete medical history is the best way to detect and prevent conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest.<\/p>\n<p>We need to start checking the hearts of our students because sports are supposed to be fun, not deadly.\u00a0 It\u2019s OK for us to wager on our Final Four pools.\u00a0 It\u2019s not OK for us to gamble with our children\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All eyes are set on Atlanta this weekend as it hosts the NCAA Final Four.\u00a0 For weeks, millions of Americans have been glued to their TVs to see if their team survives into the next round.
