Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve been dying to go to a concert and your friend calls at the last minute to invite you. Destiny or coincidence? What if you go to a conference out of town and find yourself sitting next to someone from a company that you\u2019ve been trying to connect with forever? Destiny or coincidence?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>I\u2019m on the fence about this subject. Since Simon\u2019s death, it is hard for me to make sense of things like this. Because, for me to believe in destiny, I have to accept that my son died for a reason. That\u2019s a tall order.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>Simon was born on October 21, 2004. He was a seemingly healthy baby. He died in his sleep on January 24, 2005. Following his death, our family got their hearts checked and I discovered a heart condition that is attributed to up to <a href=\"http:\/\/cardiovascres.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/67\/3\/388\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:0}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">15% of SIDS deaths<\/a>. It is called <a href=\"http:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/services\/heart\/disorders\/arrhythmia\/long-qt-syndrome\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:1}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Long QT Syndrome<\/a> (LQTS). In his memory, we established Simon\u2019s Fund to raise awareness about sudden cardiac arrest and death in children.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>On the other hand, since his passing, some things have happened that are very difficult to explain. It is impossible for me to write them off as mere coincidence.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>You be the judge.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>The Third Angel Day<\/strong>. We call it his angel day &#8211; the day that Simon died. In 2007, Melissa Fair attended Simon\u2019s Fund\u2019s very first heart screening. She discovered two structural conditions that required open heart surgery. Her surgery took place on January 24, 2008. Out of all of the days to schedule a surgery, why did it happen on Simon\u2019s third angel day? It is always a brutally difficult day. However, knowing that Melissa\u2019s life was changed for the better makes it bearable.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>The Other Simon<\/strong>. I don\u2019t know too many kids named Simon. I like that. It\u2019s unique. Maybe even a little old school. In 2011, a local family reached out to us. Their son was getting ready to become a bar mitzvah and was looking for a community service project. We never had a student organize a screening for us, but it seemed like a pretty cool concept. He rallied more than 300 students to attend. He worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fox29.com\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FOX29<\/a> to get his EKG exam <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=us7Ee7y86BY\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:3}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on the air<\/a> to educate the public. He created a new model for our organization that has led to many more screenings and projects spearheaded by students. Of course, his name was Simon.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>The Seventh Birthday<\/strong>. Drew Harrington played a lot of basketball. He used to complain to his mother that his heart beat felt strange at times. His mom attributed it to all of the caffeinated beverages he consumed. In 2012, Drew was one of the students who attended \u201cThe Other Simon\u2019s\u201d heart screening. Drew discovered a heart condition called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/diseases-conditions\/wolff-parkinson-white\/basics\/definition\/con-20043508\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome<\/a>, an arrhythmia. On October 21, 2012, he had a procedure to correct the problem. This would have been Simon\u2019s seventh birthday. It is so hard to be joyous on Simon\u2019s birthday. It is a day when I should be throwing parties, taking photos and helping him open gifts. However, Drew has given us something to celebrate.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>The Ninth Birthday<\/strong>. Our ongoing ritual was to escape on Simon\u2019s birthday. We just wanted to be alone. I didn\u2019t want to deal with the conversations or glances that come with a birthday after your child has passed. Simon\u2019s Fund was finalizing its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aO0KfD52VMk\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:5}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">educational video<\/a> on sudden cardiac arrest for coaches pursuant to the passage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/legislation-by-state\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:6}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act<\/a>. We received amazing news.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JimmyRobertsNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:7}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jimmy Roberts<\/a> of NBC Sports agreed to narrate the video. There was a caveat &#8211; Jimmy was only available to record in studio on October 21. The video is now being used by state governments and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfhs.org\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:8}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Federation of State High School Associations<\/a> to educate millions of coaches around the country.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>The Eleventh Birthday<\/strong>. Sudden death is a good way to decide a hockey game, not lose a teammate. Sudden cardiac arrest is the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.screenacrossamerica.org\/about-us\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:9}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#1 cause of death<\/a> of student athletes. This year, Simon\u2019s Fund launched A Czech for Hearts with the<a href=\"http:\/\/flyers.nhl.com\/\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:10}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Philadelphia Flyers<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/nhl\/player\/_\/id\/3781\/jakub-voracek\" target=\"_hplink\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:11}}\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jakub Voracek<\/a> to bring awareness to the cause. Every time the Flyers win in overtime, Jakub donates $1,000 to Simon\u2019s Fund for free heart screenings. The season began on October 8. On October 21, the Flyers won their first game of the season . . . and it was in sudden death. Happy Birthday, Simon.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p><strong>Just This Week<\/strong>. On Monday night (November 23), my husband and I went to the Flyers game and meet Jakub Voracek. We were excited to thank him for helping us launch such a meaningful awareness campaign. The Flyers got off to a quick 2 &#8211; 0 lead. In the third period, the Carolina Hurricanes scored two. The game was tied at the end of regulation. Twenty-four seconds into sudden death, the Flyers scored. Simon\u2019s Fund received another $1,000 from Jakub. To date, the Flyers have won seven games. Three have been decided in sudden death.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>There is a very old clich\u00e9 &#8211; everything happens for a reason. Literally, this is true. It rains because the clouds fill up with water. A dog chases a ball when we throw it. However, it is not always the reason that is so important. It is the purpose.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>I still can\u2019t answer the question &#8211; is it destiny or coincidence. I also don\u2019t want to admit that there was a reason for his death. Selfishly, I have a thousand reasons for him to be with me today. However, I can see the purpose.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>His death revealed true friendships. It brought amazing people into my life (some listed above). It widened my eyes to the generosity of and goodness in others. It brought awareness to millions of people. It may have even saved a few lives.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component mt-paragraph text\">\n<p>During this holiday season, I hope that you find gratitude and purpose in your life.
