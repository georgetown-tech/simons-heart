He traveled 26.2 miles. Upon arrival, he dropped dead.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/simonsoriginal.local:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/marathon.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5697 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/simonsoriginal.local:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/marathon.jpg\" alt=\"marathon\" width=\"250\" height=\"156\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>According to a cursory Google search, three runners this year collapsed from sudden cardiac arrest after a running event: \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailyherald.com\/article\/20131110\/news\/711109869\/\">Naperville Half Marathon<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wtoc.com\/story\/23924174\/rock-n-roll-marathon-participant-collapses-and-dies\">Rock n&#8217; Roll Savannah Marathon<\/a>, and\u00a0the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.post-gazette.com\/region\/2013\/05\/05\/No-sign-of-problem-before-runner-s-death-in-Pittsburgh-s-half-marathon\/stories\/201305050255\">Pittsburgh Half Marathon<\/a>. There are probably more.<\/p>\n<p>In Philadelphia, we just witnessed another well attended and highly successful <a href=\"http:\/\/articles.philly.com\/2013-11-19\/sports\/44205811_1_philadelphia-marathon-joseph-nderitu-half-marathon\">marathon<\/a>. I can&#8217;t imagine how much planning goes into these events: logistics, safety, hospitality and more. Leading up to the event, we read about one of the biggest concerns &#8211; a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/philadelphia.cbslocal.com\/2013\/11\/15\/security-tightened-for-philadelphia-marathon-in-wake-of-boston-bombing\/\">terrorist attack<\/a>. What was our city going to do to protect runners and spectators from danger?<\/p>\n<p>I think we were focused on the wrong conversation, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that Pheidippides would agree. \u00a0The Boston Marathon <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/04\/16\/us\/witnesses-describe-scene-of-carnage-after-blasts-at-boston-marathon.html?_r=0\">bombing<\/a> was horrific. It killed three runners and wounded over 100. It tarnished an iconic event and shattered our sense of security.<\/p>\n<p>However, I wanted to hear a discussion about sudden cardiac arrest because two years ago, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.philly.com\/philly\/blogs\/sportsinq\/Two-runners-die-at-Philadelphia-Marathon.html\">two runners dropped dead<\/a> at this very marathon. Yes, in this city, and in every other city around the country, the risk of losing runners to sudden cardiac arrest is greater than in a terrorist attack.<\/p>\n<p>We could have benefitted from a news story about the warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest or the locations of AED devices. We could have also benefitted from the investment. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amny.com\/urbanite-1.812039\/unprecedented-safeguards-in-place-for-sunday-s-nyc-marathon-1.6357935\">New York doubled the security<\/a> around its recent marathon to $1M. That could pay for a lot of AED devices or heart screenings.<\/p>\n<p>It seems like we only need to look at history to determine that the heart is a bigger threat to runners than terrorists. By the way, the sudden cardiac arrest is the #1 cause of death of adults in this country so the benefit of investing in these safety measures goes way beyond the race. I&#8217;m not sure the same applies to race day counter-terrorism efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a good chance that the race organizers and city officials will ignore history in favor of sensationalism. Nothing motivates people more than a boogie man or a bombing. Therefore, I propose another change too. From here on out, SCA will stand for sudden cardiac Al-Qaeda.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pheidippides WAS the first. Unfortunately, he wasn&#8217;t the last.
