As the practice wound down, the team was working on light sprints when the student lost consciousness. \u00a0While one parent in the audience &#8212; a doctor &#8212; rushed forward to perform CPR, a student fetched one of SJR&#8217;s two defibrillator machines. The doctor attempted to rescucitate the boy with the defibrillator until paramedics arrived. The teen was rushed to Children&#8217;s Hospital, where he died. \u00a0In a letter to parents and students, Johnson described the student as a &#8220;wonderful friend&#8221; with a &#8220;quiet, good nature and kind heart.&#8221; \u00a0Johnson praised the coaches, parents and students at the practice for taking quick and decisive steps to try to save the teen&#8217;s life. &#8220;I was very proud with the way they responded to a really shocking event,&#8221; he said, noting SJR students received training in CPR.<\/p>\n<p><a
