However, for some players, survival takes on a whole new meaning.\u00a0 A <a href=\"http:\/\/circ.ahajournals.org\/content\/early\/2011\/04\/05\/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.004622.abstract\">recent study<\/a> published by the American Heart Association shows that 1 out of every 3,100 NCAA Division I male basketball players is at risk of dying from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). <a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/ways-to-give\/simons-club\/\">Simon\u2019s Fund<\/a>, a Philadelphia based organization, is trying to reduce that risk providing a free heart screening for over 300 students in an Atlanta suburb on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p><b>Wichita State Has Firsthand Experience with Heart Conditions<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Guy Alang-Ntang was recruited by the Shockers in 2008. He would have graduated last year, and with a little good fortune, played in the NBA. Instead, Alang-Ntang <a href=\"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/ncb\/news\/story?id=2840755\">dropped dead<\/a> of an undetected heart condition during a pick up basketball game months before starting at Wichita State.\u00a0 Coach Gregg Marshall was there the night he collapsed and died.<\/p>\n<p>Around the same time, Carl Hall, a senior forward for the Shockers, was told that his basketball career was over because he kept fainting during competition &#8212; the primary warning sign of SCA.\u00a0 He took two years off from basketball, and in 2009, was prescribed medication to control his heart condition.\u00a0 He made his way to Wichita State in 2011 and on Saturday night, he will lead the Shockers in their first Final Four appearance since 1965.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWatching Carl Hall play in the Final Four inspires us to continue to raise awareness about the importance of heart screenings for student athletes,\u201d says Darren Sudman, Executive Director of Simon\u2019s Fund, who lost his son Simon to SCA. \u201cThe big difference between Alang-Ntang and Hall is that Hall got his heart checked and treated. That\u2019s why he\u2019s here playing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><b>Local Atlanta Community Shocked by Sudden Death of Two Promising Basketball Players<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Last year, in a suburb of Atlanta, Buford High School junior, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajc.com\/news\/sports\/high-school\/buford-high-basketball-player-dies-after-collapsin\/nSCxt\/\">Adam Smith<\/a>, and Buford Middle School student, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ajc.com\/news\/news\/buford-player-12-collapses-during-game-and-\/nTn45\/\">Jeremy Nelson<\/a>, died from SCA. They were both basketball standouts. Both may have been on the road to the Final Four. SCA ended their journeys.<\/p>\n<p>On April 7, 2013, Simon\u2019s Fund, working with the Cardiovascular Group in Lawrenceville, GA, will provide over 300 free heart screenings to students from the Buford and Gwinnett County School Districts.\u00a0 In its eight- year history, Simon\u2019s Fund has provided free heart screenings to 5,500 students.\u00a0 One out of every 100 students checked discovers a heart condition.<\/p>\n<p>At the screening, every student completes a medical history, has vital signs checked, and receives an ECG \u2013 a painless, non-invasive test that takes a couple of minutes. The ECG will be evaluated by local cardiologists.\u00a0 Some students will receive an echocardiogram.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs coaches, we spend so much time preparing our players, because we don\u2019t we don\u2019t to lose a game. We need to focus on sudden cardiac arrest, because losing a student athlete is much worse,\u201d said Phil Martelli, men\u2019s basketball coach of the St. Joseph\u2019s University Hawks and First Vice President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, which is meeting in Atlanta during the Final Four.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Download Release Millions of Americans filled out their brackets and hoped that their team would survive on the Road to the Final Four.
