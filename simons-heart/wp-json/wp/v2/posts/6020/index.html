It is difficult to have a rationale conversation about healthcare costs because the system is so broken. It is hard to ascertain actual costs because there is very little consistency.\u00a0 However, as Mason is hopefully recovering, I think we should try.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fchp.org\/members\/resources\/guide-to-costs.aspx\">Fallon Health<\/a> (the first link in my Google search that revealed costs), an average doctor office EKG exam costs $43. There are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nfhs.org\/content.aspx?id=9628\">7.7 million<\/a> high school student athletes in this country.\u00a0 If each student athlete got an EKG exam, it would cost $331,100,000.<\/p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2013\/05\/08\/news\/economy\/hospital-bills\/\">report filed by CNN<\/a>, the average bill for treatment of a heart attack <i>without major complications<\/i> at a hospital is $47,695. This is not a perfect comparison, because a heart attack is not sudden cardiac arrest and a child is not an adult. However, the purposes of this discussion, this figure is good enough.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.beckershospitalreview.com\/lists\/average-cost-per-inpatient-day-across-50-states-in-2010.html\">Becker\u2019s Hospital Review<\/a>, the average cost of a day in a for-profit hospital is around $1,800, and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDwQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fpublication%2F23415626_Inter-hospital_variability_in_post-cardiac_arrest_mortality%2Ffile%2F9fcfd50b3c10b43588.pdf&ei=MI5OU923JabH7Abb94HgCA&usg=AFQjCNGD8tkxTxM7z0IeivtMAvyiVn5FoA&bvm=bv.64764171,d.ZGU\">average hospital stay<\/a> of an adult following cardiac arrest is 3.8 days.<\/p>\n<p>Combining all of the information above, it costs $47,695 to treat the heart attack and $6,840 for the hospital stay, for a total cost of $54,535.<\/p>\n<p>If we divide the cost of screening all of our student athletes ($331,100,000) by the average cost of treating an adult for a heart attack ($54,535), we get 6,071. To put another way, we could screen 8,000,000 students for the same cost of treating 6,071 students who were hospitalized from sudden cardiac arrest.<\/p>\n<p>Are there 6,000 students that suffer from cardiac arrest and survive?\u00a0 Probably, but we don\u2019t have a good understanding of that number because we\u2019ve never tracked it. Last October, the CDC and NIH finally established a sudden cardiac arrest registry for youth.<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s look at this another way.\u00a0 Youth heart screenings, in addition to discover heart conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death in our children, also reveal risk factors of hyptertension and obesity \u2013 the precursors to heart disease. Heart disease is the #1 cause of death of adults in this country \u2013 about 400,000 per year.\u00a0 By preventing heart disease among students, is there additional cost savings?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine that a society who has the tools to detect and prevent heart disease and sudden death among children doesn\u2019t use them. It\u2019s hard to believe that $1 out of every $6 spent on health care is for cardiovascular disease, or $444 billion per year. The cost to screen all of the hearts of the high school student athletes .007% of that big billion dollar number.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you\u2019re one of those numbers or economic folks who likes to assess the return on investment, what\u2019s a better strategy? Oh, and before you answer, pretend that Mason is your child. Consider the financial toll on the system and the emotional toll on his family. It all probably could have been avoided with a heart screening.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As I write this, Mason Tellez, a track athlete from Whittier High School, remains hospitalized.\u00a0 According to a statement by his mother, he collapsed during practice with an undetected heart condition.\u00a0 \u201cHe remains in serious condition, but at this point is breathing on his own.\u201d Our prayers and thoughts are with Mason and his family.
