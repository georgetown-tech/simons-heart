What we were not prepared for was what an unbelievable experience we were about to have!<\/p>\n<p>After checking in to the Ritz Carlton on Central Park South for two nights to a club room overlooking the park, we were chauffeured by the hotel to the premiere. We were ecstatic to find that our seats were up front, at the center of all the excitement. We were surrounded by A-list celebrities (Donald and Melania Trump, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld, and Gayle King to name a few), with everyone decked out for New York City\u2019s premiere of the year!<\/p>\n<p>After the movie was introduced by its producers and by Sarah Jessica Parker, we were shuttled in movie themed double-decker bus to the after-party. \u00a0The party was magnificent, an outdoor Moroccan themed party, with delicious food, and, of course, the best Cosmopolitans we have ever tasted. \u00a0We were right in the center of all of the excitement, with opportunities to speak at length to many celebrities. \u00a0We took every opportunity to discuss Simon\u2019s Fund and felt extremely proud to promote the cause. \u00a0The experience far exceeded both of our expectations.
