Now, this journey is a little bit more like a marathon. People are starting to line the streets. They want to see what is going on. They want to be a part of something special.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, it was the team from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitashealth.com\">Digitas Health<\/a>.\u00a0This week, it is our friends from <a href=\"http:\/\/mchor.synthasite.com\">Maenner-Chor<\/a>.
