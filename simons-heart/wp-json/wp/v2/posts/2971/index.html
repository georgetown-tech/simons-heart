Yeah, they never asked me for it.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t required,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, 110 high school athletes across the country died of sudden cardiac arrest, that\u2019s about one every three days. Miami Children\u2019s Hospital believes all high school athletes should have EKG screenings at no cost to the students or their families. And so, it will soon launch a brand new program to make that possible.<\/p>\n<p>One of the hospital\u2019s Health on Wheels trucks will be making the rounds at area high schools.\u00a0 Also, student athletes who want free EKGs can go to the hospital\u2019s five outpatient centers in Miami-Dade and Broward.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Anthony Rossi is the medical director for the Cardiac Intensive Care Program at Miami Children\u2019s Hospital.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe science of trying to figure out who\u2019s at greatest risk hasn\u2019t been perfected yet.\u00a0 But we do believe athletics triggers some of the fatal problems,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The American Heart Association does not recommend routine EKGs for all high school athletes. Long Q T Syndrome, a problem with the electrical conduction of the heart, can be detected with this kind of screening. The syndrome affects about 1 in 5000 children, boys more often than girls. It\u2019s more common among African Americans and it is treatable.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou could have someone for 15 years be completely asymptomatic but have a Long QT, and it\u2019s like a time bomb.\u00a0 The first time you have an episode can be associated with sudden death,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>While the volunteer cardiologists are targeting athletes, free EKGs will also be available to students who don\u2019t play sports.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe problem is you\u2019ll screen a lot of patients and you probably won\u2019t find a lot of people who are at risk, but preventing one death in a child who then has the opportunity to live a completely normal life, we think is worth it\u201d Rossi said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Miami Children&#8217;s Hospital Program starts soon By Diana Gonzalez |\u00a0 Friday, Jul 29, 2011 Carolina Richardson just started as a dancer at Florida International University, and she was at Miami Children\u2019s Hospital on Friday getting an EKG as part of her physical for college athletics.
