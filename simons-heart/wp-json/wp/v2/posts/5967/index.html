However, this time, just as the show welcomed us back for a new season, it immediately killed off a main character.<\/p>\n<p>One minute he&#8217;s laughing at the bench, and the next he is randomly shot dead? \u00a0That&#8217;s so not fair to us loyal viewers.\u00a0We were counting on watching the relationship between Alicia and Will play out this year. We were wondering what he was going to do to impact the future of the firm. We were wondering if he would turn in Peter.<\/p>\n<p>You see, we expect our television shows to entertain us, but all of them must follow a certain protocol. We like suspense and surprise, but we expect the heads up. You&#8217;re allowed to throw a wrench in the plot, but you can&#8217;t blow it up!<\/p>\n<p>There was such a backlash from this twist that the producers felt compelled to write an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbs.com\/shows\/the_good_wife\/news\/1002177\/?nm\">open letter<\/a> to explain their actions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We chose the tragic route for Will\u2019s send-off for personal reasons. We\u2019ve all experienced the sudden death of a loved one in our lives. It\u2019s terrifying how a perfectly normal and sunny day can suddenly explode with tragedy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Oh . . . now it makes total sense. This is reality TV. \u00a0Not the superficial kind that fills the airwaves about housewives, makeovers or baking competitions. \u00a0Although rooted in fiction, this was a true tragic experience, that is rarely, if ever, captured in television or cinema. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">This was the TV version of my January 24, 2005. Hopefully, this will be the closest that any of you get to that experience. I am grateful to Robert and Michelle King for using this opportunity to remind us that &#8220;death, as sad and unfair as it can be, is a part of the human experience that we want to share.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week, television audiences were stunned when Will Gardner, a main character in The Good Wife, was murdered. \u00a0Gone, in an instant.
