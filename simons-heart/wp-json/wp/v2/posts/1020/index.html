By recognizing us, you have done so much to raise awareness for our cause and we really appreciate that.<\/p>\n<p>We want to thank our friends, family, board members, medical advisory board, volunteers and supporters. They have been the driving force behind Simon\u2019s Fund and the reason that we are here tonight.<\/p>\n<p>We want to give a special thanks to Hallee Adelman \u2013 for what she\u2019s done for us and what she does for Please Touch Museum.<\/p>\n<p>We want to thank the Cardiac Team at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and the Pediatric Team at Abington Memorial Hospital.\u00a0 They have given us channels to direct our energy and make differences in the lives of children.<\/p>\n<p>Since Simon died almost six years ago, thousands of children have died from sudden cardiac arrest.\u00a0 Since we were nominated for this award, we\u2019ve read articles about nine student athletes that dropped dead &#8211; Devonte Bundley, Akhir Frazier, Reggie Garrett, Jesus Cruz, Jospin Milandu, Patrick Dinsmore, Jorden T. Pond, Dillon Menard, Larsan Korvili.<\/p>\n<p>We still have lots of hearts to check.\u00a0 We still have lots of work to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We know that 1 or 2 out of every 100 children have a potentially fatal heart condition.\u00a0 It is cheap to check a child\u2019s heart \u2013 about $50.\u00a0 We think that checking hearts should be a standard of care, like eye exams, hearing exams and dental exams.<\/p>\n<p>On a very personal note, Simon\u2019s sixth birthday is two weeks from tonight.\u00a0 We won\u2019t be having a party.\u00a0 We know that we will never be able to attend an assembly, concert, game, event or ceremony for Simon.\u00a0 So, thank you for giving us the next best thing here tonight \u2013 this award to honor his memory.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tonight, Simon&#8217;s Fund received the Great Friend to Kids Award presented by Please Touch Museum.\u00a0 It was a very special evening.\u00a0 Our remarks are below . . .
