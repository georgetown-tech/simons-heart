Conducted by the medical team from Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) led by Dr. Victoria Vetter, each student will receive an ECG exam, a physical exam, and if necessary, an echocardiogram. Simon\u2019s Fund\u2019s Norristown screening is being held in memory of Akhir Frazier, a standout basketball player, who collapsed suddenly while playing basketball at the Hank Gather\u2019s Rec Center.\u00a0 Frazier was supposed to attend Norristown Area High School this year.<\/p>\n<p>Every year thousands of children like Akhir die too soon from sudden cardiac arrest. A simple heart screening, like the one being offered by Simon\u2019s Fund this Saturday, will detect up to 85 percent of the conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death. Students may register for the screening at simonsheart.org\/register.<\/p>\n<p>Simon\u2019s Fund and CHOP have been providing heart screenings for students for the past four years and have screened more than 2,000 students.\u00a0 Aggregated data from the screenings shows that 1 out of every 100 children screened will discover a potentially fatal heart condition.\u00a0 These findings are consistent with studies conducted in Italy where all young athletes are screened.\u00a0 In Italy, the incidence of sudden cardiac death in young adults has decreased by 89 percent since implementing the mandatory screenings.<\/p>\n<p>Simon\u2019s Fund was created by Phyllis and Darren Sudman following the passing of Simon Sudman, their three-month-old son who died suddenly in his sleep in January 2004. While investigating the cause of his death, the Sudman Family was advised to get ECG exams. As a result, Phyllis Sudman was diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome, a condition that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and\/or death.\u00a0 Most of these conditions can be detected with an ECG exam and treated with medication.\u00a0 Simon&#8217;s Fund is committed to raising awareness about these conditions and providing free heart screenings to students in the region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;All of our children get their eyes examined.\u00a0 They get a hearing test.\u00a0 We need to start checking their hearts too,&#8221; says Phyllis Sudman, co-founder of Simon&#8217;s Fund.\u00a0 \u201cBy providing this very inexpensive, painless and effective exam, we will decrease the number of children that drop dead from sudden cardiac arrest.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To register and attend the screening, please visit dev.simonsheart.org\/register or email events@simonsfund.org.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simon\u2019s Fund Continues Mission to Help Save
