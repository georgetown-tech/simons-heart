With your pen stroke here today, you will save the lives of children.<\/p>\n<p>A good friend of ours always says that we are members of a club that no one wants to join.\u00a0 Phyllis and I became members of that club on January 24, 2005, when our three month old son, Simon, died.\u00a0 There are other club members here today \u2013 the Rodgers Family, the Silva Family and the Frazier family.\u00a0 It was Akhir Frazier\u2019s story that brought me to Representative Vereb\u2019s office.<\/p>\n<p>Like in all clubs, the members get to decide what they want to get out of it.\u00a0 Our choice was simple.\u00a0 We wanted to make sure that we were the last members of this club.\u00a0 We don\u2019t want you to join. We want your kids to be safer.\u00a0 This bill is a manifestation of our choice.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that there are three approaches to tackling sudden cardiac arrest and death in children. These approaches are not mutually exclusive.\u00a0 They work together, in concert.<\/p>\n<p>The first approach is DETECTION.\u00a0 We need to discover these conditions before they hurt our children.\u00a0 Simon\u2019s Fund works with schools and organizations to provide free heart screenings.\u00a0 To date, we\u2019ve checked almost 4,000 hearts and helped at least 38 students discover potentially life threatening heart conditions.\u00a0 Some of those students are sitting here today.<\/p>\n<p>This weekend, we\u2019ll be at the Liacouris Center with the Athlete Health Organization to provide free sports physicals for over 1,000 high school students in Philly.\u00a0\u00a0 Every student will receive an ECG exam.<\/p>\n<p>The second approach is REACTION; how do we respond when a child collapses.\u00a0 By having AED devices spread throughout our communities, and a population that knows how to perform CPR, we will save lives when sudden cardiac arrest strikes.<\/p>\n<p>The third approach is EDUCATION. The Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prevention Act accomplishes this.\u00a0 Representative Mike Vereb summed it up best &#8211; he said that sudden cardiac arrest is now a household term.\u00a0 Parents will now be AWARE that sudden cardiac arrest kills at least 2,000 students every year and they\u2019ll guard against it.<\/p>\n<p>Coaches will now be AWARE that fainting is not acceptable and Gatorade is not the remedy.\u00a0 As a State, we will take these symptoms seriously and do a better job of protecting our children.<\/p>\n<p>This is a tremendous step forward in our quest to save young lives.\u00a0 We are so proud to be a part of it.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to close on a personal note.\u00a0 Phyllis and I cherish this moment. \u00a0Simon would have been in first grade this year, positioned nicely in between our daughter, Sally and our son, Jaden.\u00a0\u00a0 We are so happy that they are here with us today.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re never going to get to go to Simon\u2019s soccer games, choir concerts or graduations. Our moments with him are limited. This bill signing is one of those moments.\u00a0 This is our ceremony for him.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I want to share a phrase from one of our favorite songs.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be with me;\u00a0Like a handprint on my heart.\u00a0And now whatever way our stories end;\u00a0I know you have re-written mine<\/p>\n<p>This legislation will be the handprint of Simon and Representative Mike Vereb on the hearts of children throughout Pennsylvania.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I need to begin by saying thank you to Jennaphr Frederick, Josh Weisman, Brian Kadunc and Representative Mike Vereb.\u00a0 The universe brought all of us together on April 14, 2011, and as a result, we are here today making a huge difference in the lives students.
