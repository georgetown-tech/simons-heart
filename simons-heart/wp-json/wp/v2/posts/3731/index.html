It is tough saying goodbye to your nine year old child. For me, it&#8217;s even harder. I&#8217;ve had my &#8220;two child household&#8221; reduced to one child before. Staring into an empty bedroom that used to be filled with activity is very unsettling. I&#8217;m not suggesting that missing a child who is away at camp is anything like the missing feeling after a child has died. That would be irrational . . . but emotions are not always rational. However, I&#8217;m hoping that there is a similarity here.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that Sally is not with me. I don&#8217;t hear her. I can&#8217;t hug her. I don&#8217;t get to experience her. Every day, I search the camp&#8217;s website for photos. I am hoping for a glimpse. I am hoping that she&#8217;s safe. I am hoping that she&#8217;s happy. Fortunately, she is. I just saw a photo of her showing off a chocolate cake that she baked. She has the biggest smile. The photos are comforting and reassuring.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/simonsoriginal.local:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/sally-cake.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3734\" title=\"sally cake\" src=\"https:\/\/simonsoriginal.local:8080\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/06\/sally-cake.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"192\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I wish there were photos from heaven. \u00a0I can only hope that heaven is a lot like summer camp. \u00a0I&#8217;d love to see his smile and know that he is safe and maybe even having fun.
