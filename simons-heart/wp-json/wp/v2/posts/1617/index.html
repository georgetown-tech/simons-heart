today by the medical experts called upon to discuss sudden cardiac arrest and student athletes.\u00a0 As crazy as this sounds, their figure is much more misleading because we expect their figure to be rooted in research, science and fact.\u00a0 Quite simply, it is not.<\/p>\n<p>There is no registry of deaths attributed to sudden cardiac arrest, so\u00a0these medical experts are guestimating.\u00a0 This may be\u00a0a great way to give your colleagues\u00a0a look into how many\u00a0doctors\u00a0attended\u00a0a CME, but it is a very\u00a0destructful\u00a0way to frame a debate about heart screenings and the lives of our children.\u00a0 It borders on negligent.<\/p>\n<p>I assume that you&#8217;re counting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/stories\/2011\/03\/04\/national\/main20039182.shtml\">Wes Leonard<\/a> in your 40.\u00a0 We learned that\u00a0he had an enlarged heart.\u00a0\u00a0What about the student that dies in a pool and the media reports it as a drowning?\u00a0 Do we ignore the fact that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthnewsdigest.com\/news\/Safety_310\/Are_Swimming_Pools_Safe.shtml\">70% of all deaths\u00a0in aquatic facilities are cardiac related<\/a>?\u00a0 \u00a0How about\u00a0the baby that dies and the coroner quickly determines the cause of death was\u00a0SIDS?\u00a0 Do we ignore the fact that up to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sidscenter.org\/TopicalBib\/LongQTSyndrome.html\">15% of all SIDS deaths <\/a>are attributed to Long QT Syndrome?\u00a0 Thank God that we didn&#8217;t do this when Simon died.\u00a0\u00a0Phyllis would never have been diagnosed with Long QT Syndrome.\u00a0 What about\u00a0a kid\u00a0that dies in auto accidents when weather, speeding, drugs and alcohol have been ruled out?\u00a0 You can&#8217;t drive very well when you&#8217;ve passed from a cardiac event.\u00a0 Finally, what about the kids that collapse and are resuscitated by CPR and\/or an AED?\u00a0 Fortunately, they didn&#8217;t die, but presumably they could have benefited from an ECG exam.<\/p>\n<p>We need to\u00a0debate the efficacy of ECG screenings for students.\u00a0 We need to\u00a0examine the costs.\u00a0 We need to\u00a0discuss the fact that for every 100 kids that Simon&#8217;s Fund (and other organizations)\u00a0screen, one\u00a0discovers\u00a0a heart condition.\u00a0 But please, don&#8217;t avoid the debate and in the process\u00a0diminish the life of my son and the many other victims of sudden cardiac arrest with your guestimates.\u00a0
