The more common structural conditions are anomalous coronary artery,\u00a0arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD),\u00a0hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u00a0(HCM), left ventricular non-compaction, and\u00a0Marfan syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>An electrical defect interrupts the heart\u2019s rhythm. The more common electrical conditions are\u00a0Brugada syndrome,\u00a0complete heart block,\u00a0Long QT syndrome, and\u00a0Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome\u00a0(WPW).<\/p>\n<p>Commotio cordis is the one condition that has no warning signs and is not genetic. It occurs from a blow to the chest by a ball or other blunt object. It strikes at the exact wrong time causing the heart to go into a fatal heartbeat (arrhythmia).<\/p>\n<p>Most conditions can be detected with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simonsheart.org\/electrocardiogram\/\">electrocardiogram<\/a> (ECG), but many of the structural conditions can only be diagnosed with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simonsheart.org\/echocardiogram\/\">echocardiogram<\/a> (Echo). The treatment varies by condition and severity. Many can be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. The more severe cases may be treated with a pacemaker, implanted defibrillator (ICD), or corrective surgery.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on any of these conditions, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simonsheart.org\/best-resources-page\/\">Best Resources Page<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are two types of heart conditions \u2013 structural and electrical.
