He weighed almost seven pounds and had an APGAR scores of eight and nine.

Simon\u2019s pediatrician told Phyllis and Darren to have their hearts checked, since unknown causes can be passed from parents to children. They wanted to know if Simon\u2019s death could have been heart-related, and they were worried about Sally.<\/p>\n<p>Phyllis was diagnosed with <a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/about-us\/our-story\/long-qt-syndrome\/\">Long QT Syndrome<\/a> (LQTS), an arrhythmia that can cause fainting and sudden death. This condition has been linked to up to 15% of all SIDS deaths and is one of several conditions that cause <a href=\"https:\/\/simonsheart.org\/protect-this-heart\/sudden-cardiac-arrest\/\">sudden cardiac arrest<\/a> in children.<\/p>\n<p>There is not much more to share about Simon.
