Does any of it save a life?<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, two Georgia boys (9 and 10) saved an infant\u2019s life using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.simonsheart.org\/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation\/\">cardiopulmonary resuscitation<\/a> (CPR). They weren\u2019t certified. They never took a formal course. Every day, they walked by a poster in the cafeteria. It is that easy!<\/p>\n<p>We believe that teaching CPR to students should be made fun and engaging. Yes, saving a life is serious, but learning how to do it doesn't have to be. If students are not intimidated by the process, they'll be more inclined to help. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.simonsheart.org\/cpr-jukebox\">CPR Jukebox<\/a> is our answer to teaching hands-only CPR to students.<\/p>\n<p>Most state legislatures have made it clear that CPR is important and students should learn it. Some states require it as a graduation requirement. Other states leave it to the discretion of the schools. The amount of time required differs by state. The majority of states follow the methods and teachings of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.redcross.org\/take-a-class\/cpr\/cpr-training\/cpr-programs-for-schools\">American Red Cross<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/cpr.heart.org\/en\/training-programs\/community-programs\/community-resources\">American Heart Association<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Required<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Alabama<br \/>\nArizona<br \/>\nArkansas<br \/>\nCalifornia<br \/>\nConnecticut<br \/>\nDelaware<br \/>\nGeorgia<br \/>\nIdaho<br \/>\nIllinois<br \/>\nIndiana<br \/>\nIowa<br \/>\nKentucky<br \/>\nLouisiana<br \/>\nMaine<br \/>\nMaryland<br \/>\nMichigan<br \/>\nMinnesota<br \/>\nMississippi<br \/>\nMissouri<br \/>\nMontana<br \/>\nNew Jersey<br \/>\nNew Mexico<br \/>\nNew York<br \/>\nNevada<br \/>\nNorth Carolina<br \/>\nOhio<br \/>\nOklahoma<br \/>\nOregon<br \/>\nRhode Island<br \/>\nSouth Carolina<br \/>\nSouth Dakota<br \/>\nTennessee<br \/>\nTexas<br \/>\nUtah<br \/>\nVermont<br \/>\nVirginia<br \/>\nWashington<br \/>\nWest Virginia<br \/>\nWisconsin<br \/>\nWashington, D.C.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Optional<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Colorado<br \/>\nNorth Dakota<br \/>\nPennsylvania<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Not Addressed<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Alaska<br \/>\nFlorida<br \/>\nHawaii<br \/>\nKansas<br \/>\nMassachusetts<br \/>\nNebraska<br \/>\nNew Hampshire<br \/>\nWyoming<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How much of what you learned in high school helps you today?
