										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by the life of Nadiir King who passed away in 2014 from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Simon&#8217;s Heart is teaming up with Jefferson Washington Township Hospital, Washington Township HS, and the Sharp family to offer free heart screenings for any student aged 12 &#8211; 19.</p>
<p>The screening will take place at Washington Township HS on October 13th. There is no cost for the screening. It has been underwritten by donations from other parents.</p>
<p>The screening is intended for students who have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> received an ECG exam or been examined by a cardiologist. The screening will look for undetected heart conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death in the young, but is not a substitute for annual pediatric wellness visits.</p>
<p>To register, you will need to complete consent, medical and family history forms.</p>
