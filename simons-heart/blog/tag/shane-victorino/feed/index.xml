										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every screening has a different origin, a different path and a different outcome.  Our screening at the Shane Victorino Boys and Girls Club was no different. A student that had gotten her heart screened at one of our first heart screenings got a summer internship with the Victorino Foundation. She suggested that we provide a heart screening for the members of the Club. We rarely get the opportunity to do screenings in Philadelphia, so we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>We were able to screen 41 students. Two required follow up for suspected heart conditions. We also donated an AED device to their facility. Our hope is that this will lead to screenings for and AED devices at the other <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx">Boys & Girls Clubs</a> in Philadelphia and around the country.</p>
