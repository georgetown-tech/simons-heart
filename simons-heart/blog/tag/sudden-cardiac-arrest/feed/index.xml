										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The competition throughout the NCAA basketball season is always high but as soon as March rolls around it changes dramatically. March Madness. Teams are no longer just competing against other teams, but they are competing for spots, wins, and championships. Brackets start forming, bets are on the table and the conversations start. Conversations about upsets, final four and championships but never heart conditions, AED devices or sudden cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>When you sit and watch the games, your main focus is that game. You aren’t thinking about injuries, the what-ifs or even heart issues. I know Shaquille O’Neal does. His 19-year-old son, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2018/09/28/uclas-shareef-oneal-to-miss-season-with-heart-ailment/37975417/">Shareef</a> was diagnosed with a heart condition at the end of last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sudden cardiac arrest is the number one cause of death of student-athletes. In fact, every three days a young athlete in the US collapses and dies due to an undetected heart condition.</p></blockquote>
<p>People typically don’t pay attention to the statistics unless it&#8217;s newsworthy and they read about it on their sports app. NCAA basketball players have a 1 in 3,000 chance of experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest event. In this NCAA tournament alone, there are three players and two coaches that have dealt with a heart-related issue. That is about 8%.</p>
<p>Minnesota a No. 10 seed will play today at 12:15 pm against No. 7 seed Louisville in the first round of the NCAA tournament. Did you know that Jarvis Johnson, a four-star prospect out of high school, recruited by ISU, was never able to suit up for Minnesota? Why? A heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was never cleared to play competitively and his career as a basketball player was cut short. As a sixth man, he is watching and cheering on his teammates from the sidelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/sports/ohio-state/2019/02/13/once-an-unheralded-recruit-Andre-Wesson-rises-up-for-Ohio-State/stories/20190213011">Andre Wesson</a> from Ohio State is a prized defender. There was a good chance that Ohio State wouldn’t have been at the No. 11 seed if it wasn’t for his skills, attitude, and progression this season. It is a big surprise to learn that Wesson had a slow start last season due to a heart issue that was discovered by the Ohio State’s team doctors.</p>
<p>Making it this far in the NCAA tournament felt like an impossibility to <a href="http://theacc.com/news/2019/3/13/mens-basketball-virginia-techs-ty-outlaw-named-bradley-award-winner.aspx">Ty Outlaw</a> at Virginia Tech in 2015 when he was diagnosed with a heart condition. A heart condition that threatened to end his Hokies career. Outlaw was having difficulties recovering after drills during the preseason. Virginia Tech knew about a septal defect that Outlaw was born with that caused murmurs along with his high blood pressure. His struggles continued when he learned about his diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. That was enough to shut him down in the 2015-2016 season. Now Outlaw has the reputation as being one of the top 3-point shooters in the ACC. Pretty impressive for someone with a heart condition.</p>
<p>No. 2 Michigan and No. 15 Montana will be facing off today at 9:20 pm. Who would have thought that both coaches have dealt with heart issues? Michigan <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/24796749/john-beilein-michigan-reflects-offseason-heart-surgery">Coach John Beilein</a> had a double bypass heart operation. <a href="http://406mtsports.com/college/frontier-conference/university-of-providence/providence-men-s-basketball-coach-steve-keller-on-the-mend/article_96d8b9ea-5bd4-521c-9e90-b8791313107c.html">Montana Coach Steve Keller</a> endured a heart attack just a few months ago.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the players above have happy endings. They might not be able to follow their dreams to play in the tournament or even the NBA but their life wasn’t cut short. In this month alone there were six teens that lost their lives from an undiagnosed heart condition or sudden cardiac arrest. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/pennsylvania-teen-13-dies-after-sudden-cardiac-arrest-school-says">Daron Lewis Godbee</a>, 13; <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/newville-teen-big-spring-pennsylvania-basketball-heart-attack/">Jonathan “JT” Kuhn</a>, 16; <a href="https://www.ktbs.com/news/caddo-parish-schools-mourns-the-loss-of-domanique-jones/article_34c9d6f6-3aeb-11e9-90af-8355eee1db59.html">Domanique Jones</a>, 18; <a href="https://www.fredericksburg.com/news/local/fredericksburg/jmhs-mourns-death-of-student-who-collapsed-during-gym-class/article_2e3a087c-c281-5383-bbc3-718fd03a8e29.html">Anonymous student</a>, 16; <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/07/high-school-football-player-dies-after-passing-out-in-weight-room/">Jermaine Falcaer</a>, 16; and Scott Krulcik, 22.</p>
<blockquote><p>These deaths could have been prevented with heart screenings or the use of an AED device.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon’s Heart is dedicated to changing the standard of care to screen all kids and make AED devices readily available in all schools and youth facilities. You never know if a seemingly healthy athlete could have a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>As you continue to follow the NCAA tournament, change your perspective. Learn about the warning signs that lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Understand what an AED device is. Recognize where the closest device might be. Get your hearts checked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://simonsoriginal.local:8080/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Wichita-State-Release-4.2.13.pdf">Download Release</a></p>
<p>Millions of Americans filled out their brackets and hoped that their team would survive on the Road to the Final Four. However, for some players, survival takes on a whole new meaning.  A <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2011/04/05/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.004622.abstract">recent study</a> published by the American Heart Association shows that 1 out of every 3,100 NCAA Division I male basketball players is at risk of dying from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). <a href="/ways-to-give/simons-club/">Simon’s Fund</a>, a Philadelphia based organization, is trying to reduce that risk providing a free heart screening for over 300 students in an Atlanta suburb on Sunday.</p>
<p><b>Wichita State Has Firsthand Experience with Heart Conditions</b></p>
<p>Guy Alang-Ntang was recruited by the Shockers in 2008. He would have graduated last year, and with a little good fortune, played in the NBA. Instead, Alang-Ntang <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2840755">dropped dead</a> of an undetected heart condition during a pick up basketball game months before starting at Wichita State.  Coach Gregg Marshall was there the night he collapsed and died.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Carl Hall, a senior forward for the Shockers, was told that his basketball career was over because he kept fainting during competition &#8212; the primary warning sign of SCA.  He took two years off from basketball, and in 2009, was prescribed medication to control his heart condition.  He made his way to Wichita State in 2011 and on Saturday night, he will lead the Shockers in their first Final Four appearance since 1965.</p>
<p>“Watching Carl Hall play in the Final Four inspires us to continue to raise awareness about the importance of heart screenings for student athletes,” says Darren Sudman, Executive Director of Simon’s Fund, who lost his son Simon to SCA. “The big difference between Alang-Ntang and Hall is that Hall got his heart checked and treated. That’s why he’s here playing.”</p>
<p><b>Local Atlanta Community Shocked by Sudden Death of Two Promising Basketball Players</b></p>
<p>Last year, in a suburb of Atlanta, Buford High School junior, <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/high-school/buford-high-basketball-player-dies-after-collapsin/nSCxt/">Adam Smith</a>, and Buford Middle School student, <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/buford-player-12-collapses-during-game-and-/nTn45/">Jeremy Nelson</a>, died from SCA. They were both basketball standouts. Both may have been on the road to the Final Four. SCA ended their journeys.</p>
<p>On April 7, 2013, Simon’s Fund, working with the Cardiovascular Group in Lawrenceville, GA, will provide over 300 free heart screenings to students from the Buford and Gwinnett County School Districts.  In its eight- year history, Simon’s Fund has provided free heart screenings to 5,500 students.  One out of every 100 students checked discovers a heart condition.</p>
<p>At the screening, every student completes a medical history, has vital signs checked, and receives an ECG – a painless, non-invasive test that takes a couple of minutes. The ECG will be evaluated by local cardiologists.  Some students will receive an echocardiogram.</p>
<p>“As coaches, we spend so much time preparing our players, because we don’t we don’t to lose a game. We need to focus on sudden cardiac arrest, because losing a student athlete is much worse,” said Phil Martelli, men’s basketball coach of the St. Joseph’s University Hawks and First Vice President of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, which is meeting in Atlanta during the Final Four.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hopefully, I&#8217;m not the only one that spends this time of year reflecting.</p>
<p>We are expected to focus on those things for which we are thankful. Sometimes, I think it is too easy, almost cliche, for us share our expressions of thanks. Our kids get trained in this skill beginning in preschool. [Said in a cute Kindergarten Cop voice]: &#8220;I am thankful for my family, friends and toys.&#8221; Within hours, they are complaining about friends or family and wanting more toys.</p>
<p>Something this year made me open up the eulogy I gave at Simon&#8217;s funeral. I guess I wanted to see how my &#8220;thankfulness&#8221; had changed. Here&#8217;s some of what I found:</p>
<p>&#8220;A couple months ago, we got together with friends over breakfast and started talking about how fortunate we all were. Someone commented, that it was almost too good to be true – it’s probably only a matter of time until something bad happens to even it out. I don’t agree with that. The truth is, we’re still very fortunate. We have a beautiful daughter, a big family, a nice house, incredible friends, good health and financial security. Simon did not take any of this away with him – he left it in tact for us to enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year, I have more reasons to be thankful. In August, the Board of Directors asked me to serve as Executive Director of Simon&#8217;s Fund. I resisted at first because Simon&#8217;s Fund was created to be a tribute to our son, not a job for me. After some soul searching and deep conversations with others who had walked in my shoes, I accepted.</p>
<p>These past three months have been a gift, professionally and personally. Professionally, I have been able to rekindle relationships, explore new partnerships and engage new lawmakers. We have established better systems, expanded our heart screenings, focused on a national youth ECG database, and reorganized the Board, including electing a new Executive Committee. Personally, I have been able to spend more time with my family. Life is much more focused, and in a strange way, simpler.</p>
<p>This new and improved organization is going to give us the opportunity to really make an impact on the lives of children. We will check more hearts and save more lives. We will pass more life-saving legislation. We will inspire more research of sudden cardiac arrest and death in children. To date, we have screened almost 5,500 students and helped 49 discover heart conditions.</p>
<p>It is hard to be thankful after losing a child, but not impossible, especially when I have so many tremendous people by my side and limitless opportunities ahead.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every screening has a different origin, a different path and a different outcome.  Our screening at the Shane Victorino Boys and Girls Club was no different. A student that had gotten her heart screened at one of our first heart screenings got a summer internship with the Victorino Foundation. She suggested that we provide a heart screening for the members of the Club. We rarely get the opportunity to do screenings in Philadelphia, so we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>We were able to screen 41 students. Two required follow up for suspected heart conditions. We also donated an AED device to their facility. Our hope is that this will lead to screenings for and AED devices at the other <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx">Boys & Girls Clubs</a> in Philadelphia and around the country.</p>
