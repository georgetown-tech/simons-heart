										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best way to capture the success and sentiment from the Upper Dublin Heart Screening is to share an email that we sent to Jill Florin. Jill&#8217;s daughter, Paige, invited us to come to Upper Dublin. This was her bat mitzvah project.</p>
<p>Jill &#8211;</p>
<p>Phyllis and I want to know how happy, honored, proud and pleased we are to have worked with your family on the Upper Dublin heart screening.  When your kid dies, you don&#8217;t know how or if you&#8217;ll be able to make it.  You fight to convince yourself that things will get better and that maybe there was a reason.  You don&#8217;t necessarily believe it, but you try.</p>
<p>Then, as the years go by, you get to meet new people and engage in new activities as a result of the horrible tragedy.  Also, if you are lucky, you get to make someone else&#8217;s life a little better and safer.</p>
<p>We would not have met your family, but for Simon&#8217;s death.  We would not have experienced the sunshine and maturity of Paige, and the tireless passion and dedication of you.  We would not have worked along side Larry and Evan or any of the other amazing people you brought to the event.  We would not have raised awareness in your community.  We would not have touched 315 student lives in Upper Dublin.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that four kids will live safer lives as a result of Paige&#8217;s mitzvah project.  That&#8217;s defines mitzvah, right?</p>
<p>When our kids turn 13, they automatically become a bat mitzvah.  By turning, 13, they are recognized as an adult.  The service is just a way for our children to acknowledge this responsibility.  We know that Paige is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>However, as far as we&#8217;re concerned, Paige fulfilled her responsibility to the Jewish community on Sunday when she helped to check hearts and save lives.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Phyllis and Darren</p>
