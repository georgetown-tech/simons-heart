What started as a school project quickly turned into a screening for four independent schools &#8211; Chestnut Hill Springside, Penn Charter, Germantown Academy and Germantown Friends. Of course, students from other schools attended as well.  The final tally came in at 298.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This screening was for <a href="http://m.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2013/jan/06/another-student-death-hits-buford-community/">Jeremy</a> and <a href="http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/news/2012/sep/17/buford-athlete-dies-after-collapsing-school/">Adam</a>. These boys attended Buford schools and lived on the same street.  Within one year, they both died from sudden cardiac arrest . . . playing basketball.</p>
<p>The night before our screening, Louisville came from behind to beat Wichita State and Michigan powered through to beat Syracuse. As the world waited for the National Championship game, we worked with local doctors, first responders and volunteers to check the hearts of 225 students.  Five students were referred to a clinic for specific conditions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank the the Cardiovascular Group taking the lead and hosting this event.  They are part of the Gwinnett Medical Center.  We&#8217;d also like to thank those groups that donated their services:  Children&#8217;s Cardiovascular Medicine, Pediatric Cardiology Services, Athletic Training Services, Gwinnett County Fire and Emergency and Project ADAM.</p>
<p>We hope to be back in the fall with Jeremy Nelson&#8217;s family to screen more hearts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually, our heart screening focus on the student body of one school. However, the Decker family had something different in mind. They wanted to provide a screening for the entire Elkins Park Jewish community. Perelman Jewish Day School and Kehillah of Old York Road helped with the recruitment. On November 4, we screened 181 students. We were supported by cardiologists and technicians from Abington Memorial Hospital and St. Christopher&#8217;s Hospital. There were also plenty of community volunteers, physicians and nurses on hand. Mortara Instrument, SonoSite and Cardiac Science supported the event with machines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On October 27, 232 students from five different schools came together for a heart screening: Haveford, Agnes Irwin, Baldwin, Friends Central and Shipley. Six of them were referred for follow up. This screening represented a few firsts. There were doctors from five different hospitals checking hearts. There were medical students from two different institutions taking vitals. The schools were competing to win an AED machine.</p>
<p>The school that turned out the most students for the heart screening won an AED device to donate to another school in need. It&#8217;s time for The Haverford School to choose that school. They edged out Shipley by a few students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best way to capture the success and sentiment from the Upper Dublin Heart Screening is to share an email that we sent to Jill Florin. Jill&#8217;s daughter, Paige, invited us to come to Upper Dublin. This was her bat mitzvah project.</p>
<p>Jill &#8211;</p>
<p>Phyllis and I want to know how happy, honored, proud and pleased we are to have worked with your family on the Upper Dublin heart screening.  When your kid dies, you don&#8217;t know how or if you&#8217;ll be able to make it.  You fight to convince yourself that things will get better and that maybe there was a reason.  You don&#8217;t necessarily believe it, but you try.</p>
<p>Then, as the years go by, you get to meet new people and engage in new activities as a result of the horrible tragedy.  Also, if you are lucky, you get to make someone else&#8217;s life a little better and safer.</p>
<p>We would not have met your family, but for Simon&#8217;s death.  We would not have experienced the sunshine and maturity of Paige, and the tireless passion and dedication of you.  We would not have worked along side Larry and Evan or any of the other amazing people you brought to the event.  We would not have raised awareness in your community.  We would not have touched 315 student lives in Upper Dublin.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that four kids will live safer lives as a result of Paige&#8217;s mitzvah project.  That&#8217;s defines mitzvah, right?</p>
<p>When our kids turn 13, they automatically become a bat mitzvah.  By turning, 13, they are recognized as an adult.  The service is just a way for our children to acknowledge this responsibility.  We know that Paige is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>However, as far as we&#8217;re concerned, Paige fulfilled her responsibility to the Jewish community on Sunday when she helped to check hearts and save lives.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Phyllis and Darren</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every screening has a different origin, a different path and a different outcome.  Our screening at the Shane Victorino Boys and Girls Club was no different. A student that had gotten her heart screened at one of our first heart screenings got a summer internship with the Victorino Foundation. She suggested that we provide a heart screening for the members of the Club. We rarely get the opportunity to do screenings in Philadelphia, so we jumped at the chance.</p>
<p>We were able to screen 41 students. Two required follow up for suspected heart conditions. We also donated an AED device to their facility. Our hope is that this will lead to screenings for and AED devices at the other <a href="http://www.bgca.org/Pages/index.aspx">Boys & Girls Clubs</a> in Philadelphia and around the country.</p>

<p>This year, we screened about 800 kids; five of whom discovered potentially fatal heart conditions.  Four of these conditions were Wolff-Parkinson White Syndrome, an arrhythmia, that can cause a child to drop dead suddenly during exertion.</p>
