										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is what happens when the heart stops beating suddenly and unexpectedly. It is the leading cause of death of adults in this country. However, it is not just an adult thing. It is linked to 10% of SIDS deaths; is the leading cause of death of student athletes; and takes the lives of thousands of children every year.</p>
<p>Is it contagious?</p>
<p>Last week, two stories broke about the risk of sudden cardiac arrest in athletes. <a href="https://default.salsalabs.org/T7b4e93da-f726-4210-8658-d766c99c2d60/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cameron Smith</a>, a twenty-four year old linebacker with the Minnesota Vikings, discovered a heart condition (bicuspid aortic valve) after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Biscupid aortic valve is a condition where the aortic valve has two leaflets instead of three. The aortic valve regulates blood flow from heart to the aorta. This is a structural heart condition and is usually inherited.</p>
<p>Then, the <a href="https://default.salsalabs.org/Tea5fc6e9-4348-46c4-8761-209c7c9ca843/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Ten reported</a> at least ten players were diagnosed with myocarditis after testing positive for COVID-19. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle (called myocardium) that limits the heart&#8217;s ability to pump blood. This condition is also structural, but it is acquired. It is caused by things like a virus or a drug interaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that COVID-19 can attack the heart, said David Shipon, a cardiologist at Jefferson University Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of Simon&#8217;s Heart. &#8220;Typically, the worse the symptoms are from COVID, the greater the likelihood that the heart will become inflamed. But, all physically active individuals who are diagnosed with COVID should get their hearts screened because we are still learning about the effects of this virus.&#8221;</p>
<p>These stories amplify our message &#8211; testing and screening are so important. It is not enough for us to assume that Cameron&#8217;s heart was healthy for the first two decades of his life. He and all of his high school classmates should have been screened. He is an elite athlete. He won a state championship in high school, played at USC for four years, and was drafted by the NFL. Should he have to wait for a pandemic to find something so significant?</p>
<p>The case of the Big Ten players underscores the importance of screening for a different reason. It is not enough to report positive tests, hospitalizations and fatalities of COVID-19. We need to understand how this virus is compromising the hearts and other parts of our children. Over <a href="https://default.salsalabs.org/T39fefe37-5b25-41b0-83cd-e8f24d98b515/7215b599-ddb2-485e-bbac-830cd681e0da" target="_top" rel="noopener noreferrer">300,000</a> children have tested positive for coronavirus, and while the mortality rate is very low today, how many of these children will suffer from heart failure or cardiac arrest in the future? We won&#8217;t know unless we screen and conduct research.</p>
<p>Sudden cardiac arrest is not contagious, although viruses like COVID-19 that can cause myocarditis are. Whether the conditions are inherited or acquired, we can prevent sudden cardiac arrest through screening and research. Our children don&#8217;t have to die from detectable and treatable heart conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember like it was yesterday. Phyllis and I had to escape from life. We had just passed the first anniversary of Simon&#8217;s death. We took Sally to the beach.</p>
<p>It was so hard to be around people with babies. It was even harder to hear about &#8220;problems.&#8221; I&#8217;m really sorry your contractor didn&#8217;t show up. It&#8217;s just awful that you had to work all weekend. We couldn&#8217;t deal with all of this. Let&#8217;s say that we needed some social distancing.</p>
<p>Bitterness and resentment are best friends with tragedy and adversity. This is especially true when life shatters your expectations. I knew how life was <em>supposed</em> to work. I grow up. I start a family. I have kids. I watch them grow up and raise their family. Then I pass on. But, that&#8217;s not my life. I was being singled out.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #fc0505;">Something happened on the beach that day and it went something like this.</span></h4>
<p>What if that is not the way life is supposed to work. Sure, it happens that way for most people I know, but that is because they are blessed and fortunate. What happens if examine the lives of the 6.6 billion people around the world? Does life really work out that way? Probably not.</p>
<p>Do I really get to expect my son to reach a certain age? What happens if I reset my expectations to zero days? Can I convince myself to be grateful for the 96 days I had?</p>
<p>Last week, someone on the news suggested that social distancing is not in place to prevent me from catching COVID-19. It is preventing me from infecting someone else. I need to assume that I am infected. Hmmm. Perspective.</p>
<p>As we shelter in place, search for a new normal, and face varying levels of adversity, I hope that you and your family can find a healthy perspective to get you through these challenging times. This too shall pass.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Dr. Dermot Phelan MD, Ph.D., FESC, FASE, FACC a staff cardiologist from the Cleveland Clinic interviews Samantha Krouse, Manager of GotAED about sudden cardiac arrest, the importance of early defibrillation and resources to get AED devices.</h4>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> The sudden cardiac death of a young athlete or pupil has a profound effect on the community at large. It often leaves people asking what more could have been done to prevent this tragic event. Could you describe the scope of this problem and what are the most common underlying causes of sudden cardiac death in the young?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> We believe that thousands of children die every year from sudden cardiac arrest.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we don’t know for sure because our medical community didn’t start tracking the causes of death of minors until recently.&nbsp; The NIH and CDC created the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-cdc-launch-registry-sudden-death-young">sudden death registry</a> and it is being piloted in a handful of states. For instance, when a student is found at the bottom of a pool, the death certificate will say drowning or asphyxiation. But, what caused this student to drown?&nbsp; It could have been an arrhythmia, which is undetectable once the heart stops beating. The same for babies who die of SIDS or young adults who die in single-car accidents when the weather is good and there is no evidence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>We can prevent these tragedies in a few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>We must know that sudden cardiac arrest is not just an adult thing.&nbsp; There are some warning signs for us to watch:&nbsp; fainting during or right after exercise, a racing heart and sudden death of a family member under the age of 50.</li>
<li>Our kids should get their hearts screened.&nbsp; Research shows that an ECG exam, when done with a physical and history, is more effective at detecting heart conditions.</li>
<li>We need to be prepared. We need to know how to do chest compressions and have an AED around.&nbsp; The AED is the only tool that can save someone in cardiac arrest.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> Could you please tell us about the importance of early effective CPR and early defibrillation on outcomes in these events?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> CPR and early defibrillation are critical, but let’s remember that they are the backup plan.&nbsp; We need these tools because we failed to detect the condition before it causes harm. CPR or chest compressions circulate blood throughout the body when the heart stops pumping.&nbsp; Without blood and oxygen, our organs will quickly fail.</p>
<p>The AED delivers a lifesaving shock to our heart. It resets the rhythm. It is the only tool that can do this.&nbsp; If someone provides bystander CPR and the use of an AED device is used within 3-5 minutes of the collapse, the survival rates are between 41%-74% (<a href="https://ksi.uconn.edu/">Korey Stringer Institute</a>). If you aren’t able to use an AED device or the device is inaccessible, the survival rates decline 7-10% per minute, every minute that defibrillation is delayed. That is why the best practice to save lives during a cardiac arrest event is to start chest compressions within 1 minute of collapse and grab the defibrillator within 3 minutes of collapse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> How can we improve education on basic life support in our communities?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> The first step to improving education is demystifying the process.&nbsp; For decades, the heart community has required hours of training, certifications, and fees. There are stickers on AED cabinets claiming that the devices are professional use only.&nbsp; The public is scared and intimidated &#8211; for good reason.&nbsp; This stuff is easy. It’s super important but so easy.&nbsp; All students should be taught how to perform CPR and how to use an AED device in school. There are 38 states that encourage CPR education before graduation.&nbsp; That’s a start.</p>
<p>There is also technology like the <a href="https://www.pulsepoint.org/">PulsePoint</a> app that alerts bystanders about cardiac arrests nearby so they can assist until the first responders arrive. Pulse Point also has an AED registry, so the devices are easier to find.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> Where should AEDs be made available?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> AED devices should be made available everywhere, including where kids learn and play. Think about all of the safety tools we have but rarely (or never) use &#8211; fire extinguisher, smoke detector, smoke alarm, and burglar alarm. These all add value and mitigate risk.&nbsp; So, does an AED device.&nbsp; Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death of adults in the US.&nbsp; The only tool that can prevent it should be everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> How much does an AED cost?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> AEDs range in value like every other appliance or tool. They can retail for $1,100 &#8211; $2,500. <a href="https://www.cardiopartners.com/">Cardio Partners</a> is our AED partner for crowdfunding site, <a href="https://www.gotaed.org/">GotAED</a>. We are able to provide devices at a lower cost because of the nature of our site.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> Please tell us about the work that <a href="https://www.gotaed.org/">GotAED</a> does?</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> GotAED is an initiative of <a href="/">Simon’s Heart</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising awareness about the warning signs and conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death in kids. We created this site to empower places to get AEDs even when they don’t have the budget to do so. We heard too many stories about youth facilities that wanted an AED but gave up because they didn’t have the money.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gotaed.org/">GotAED</a> allows youth related facilities to quickly set up a campaign and raise funds. It takes a few minutes to get started. The cost is the same for everyone &#8211; around $900 &#8211; depending on the way that you want to store the device (and your state’s sales tax).&nbsp; Once the campaign is fully funded, the device and storage container is delivered right to the door. We also partner with <a href="https://www.projectadam.com/ProjectADAM">ProjectADAM</a> to help create cardiac emergency response plans for the youth facility.</p>
<p>Within its first year, GotAED helped 30 different schools, youth organizations, libraries, community centers, sports clubs/associations, and museums get AED devices in over 18 states.</p>
<p>GotAED also launched an awareness campaign with the Philadelphia Flyers. It is called the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/flyers/news/flyers-make-first-gotaed-overtime-challenge-device-donation--philadelphia-flyers/c-298661578">Overtime Challenge</a>.&nbsp; Every time the game enters the sudden death period, an AED is donated to a local youth facility.&nbsp; Sudden death is an exciting way to win a game, but a terrible way to lose a teammate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Phelan:</strong> If someone in the community wishes to purchase an AED, where should they go to get information.</p>
<p><strong>Samantha:</strong> There are a few places that provide funding for AED grants. However, money is scarce.&nbsp; So, if funding is not available, visit <a href="https://www.gotaed.org/">GotAED.org</a> and click the red button to “<a href="https://www.gotaed.org/add-campaign/">Start a Campaign</a>.”&nbsp; I am always available to answer questions &#8211;&nbsp;samantha@gotaed.org.</p>
<p>If you have funds, we recommend Cardio Partners.&nbsp; To receive a special discount, please enter the code SIMONSHEART2019 on <a href="https://www.aed.com/">AED.com</a> to get 20% off your total purchase.&nbsp; For more information, please contact Frank Mannino at francesco.mannino@cardiopartners.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many student athletes die from steroid use? That was the first thought to cross my mind after hearing that Clemson players, Dexler Lawrence, Zach Giella and Braden Galloway, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/clemson-dl-dexter-lawrence-two-other-suspended-players-wont-play-vs-alabama/">were suspended</a> from the BCS Championship Playoff. Despite having filed an appeal last week, they won’t be on the field tonight in the Championship Game.</p>
<p>I don’t believe that death is the only consequence. Steroids are unhealthy, and using them is considered cheating. However, when steroid use is viewed against the backdrop of sudden cardiac arrest and death in sport, it really makes me wonder about our priorities.</p>
<p>The NCAA set forth its policy on steroid use in the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/sport-science-institute/ncaa-drug-testing-program">NCAA Drug Testing Program</a>. The policy identifies drugs that are “potentially harmful to the health and safety of the student-athlete.” The rationale for the policy seems to reflect a “dedication to the ideal of fair and equitable intercollegiate competition at their championships and postseason bowl games.</p>
<p>So, we’ve accepted the reality that our student athletes can be randomly tested for drugs during the season. Before the “big” game, that testing should be mandatory. We have also accepted that these tests are reliable enough to warrant suspension from “big” games, even if there’s a chance we’re wrong. In the case of the Clemson players, there are <a href="https://www.usada.org/growing-evidence-ostarine-athlete-risk/">thirty-six supplements</a> that contain the banned substance of ostarine. This is a very different approach than we’re taking to sudden cardiac arrest and death.</p>
<p>Four years ago, <a href="mailto:https://www.wsj.com/articles/ncaa-doctor-backs-off-recommending-heart-tests-for-athletes-1429291801">Brian Hainline</a>, the Chief Medical Officer of the NCAA, suggested that all high risk athletes, namely basketball and football players, be required to undergo a cardiac exam before taking the field or court. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Drezner_ECG-Screening-in-NCAA-Athletes_AJC-2016.pdf">Research</a> supports this position and shows that heart screenings are far more effective at detecting heart conditions in NCAA athletes.</p>
<p>The backlash was brutal and the idea was quickly scrapped.</p>
<p>All or nothing shouldn’t be the only choice when setting policy for the health and safety of student athletes. It’s not for steroids.</p>
<p>Last year, the news media reported the deaths of nine student athletes from suspected sudden cardiac arrest. Yet, no student athlete was randomly tested for heart conditions this season, and none of the players from Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Clemson and Alabama were required to get a heart screening before the BCS Championship Playoffs. Some schools do provide heart screenings for their student athletes. This year, <a href="https://www.mcall.com/sports/college/psu/mc-spt-penn-state-football-nana-asiedu-20180627-story.html">Penn State football</a> discovered career-ending conditions in two of its players.</p>
<p>If steroids pose a significant health risk for our student athletes, I welcome testing. If steroid use threatens the integrity of sport, let’s prevent and punish its use. But, is this about health or cheating? If it’s about health, let’s apply the same or stricter standards to testing for heart conditions. I think that we can all agree that losing a game because of cheating sucks, but losing a player is tragic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article appeared in Medpage Today.</em></p>
<p>Are physicians in Europe more curious than physicians in the United States? I get that impression after reading headlines from the <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/cardiology/arrhythmias/74483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study about soccer players and heart screenings</a> in England:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Screening <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-soccer-cardiac-screening/screening-fails-to-predict-most-heart-deaths-in-young-soccer-players-idUSKBN1KT2M8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fails to predict most heart deaths</a> in young soccer players&#8221; (<em>Reuters</em>)</li>
<li>&#8220;More young <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/08/more-young-footballers-dying-of-heart-problems-than-thought-fa-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footballers dying of heart problems</a> than thought, FA study finds&#8221; (<em>The Guardian</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many local reactions to this study, and the heart screening studies before it, have become very predictable. They are quick to raise doubts and cast judgments, like &#8220;screening fails to predict most heart deaths.&#8221; As a parent, patient, and advocate, I find these reactions to be very &#8230; curious.</p>
<p>Curiosity has played a tremendous role in my life. My son died 13 years ago. Everyone assumed it was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, our pediatrician was curious. She said, &#8220;Get your hearts checked, because babies just don&#8217;t die.&#8221; As a result, Phyllis, Simon&#8217;s mom, was diagnosed with Long QT syndrome. Long QT has been linked to up to 15% of all SIDS deaths and is one of several conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest in children.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re open to it, this study raises some great questions and reveals some areas for improvement. Here are a few that jumped out at me:</p>
<ul>
<li>The status quo does not work. The physical and survey missed 93% of the heart conditions that can lead to sudden death and 67% of other heart conditions. In other words, there were hundreds of false negatives (of the 11,168 young athletes screened). Can the ECG and/or echo help us screen better and decrease the number of false negatives?</li>
<li>The leading cause of death of adults in this country is cardiac arrest. The screening found a total of 267 heart conditions. Some were more serious than others. Won&#8217;t detecting these conditions early in life lead to better quality of life and lower healthcare costs?</li>
<li>Despite detecting 267 heart conditions, the screening failed to detect six. Some conditions take time to develop. Why? Could screening help us better understand when and why these heart conditions develop?</li>
<li>No one knows the real cost of screenings. The healthcare system is broken and pricing is erratic. Heart screenings are new. Today, we order lots of tests to learn the difference between abnormal and normal variance. Won&#8217;t the frequency and cost of additional tests decrease over time as we get smarter?</li>
<li>Six young athletes died after their conditions went undetected. Two others died after ignoring their doctor&#8217;s advice. Forty were treated and have not died. How many deaths may have been prevented from this screening? Could a second screening at a later date have prevented the six deaths? Is there a best time to screen?</li>
<li>There are two ways to prevent sudden cardiac death – detection and preparation. Screening helps to identify the conditions. CPR and automated external defibrillator (AED) devices reduce sudden death. We&#8217;re never asked to choose smoke detectors <em>or</em> fire extinguishers, so why should we have to choose between ECG and AED?</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m biased. My son died from an undetected heart condition. My organization, Simon&#8217;s Heart, has helped students discover heart conditions. Parents have thanked me for saving their child&#8217;s life. But, even I don&#8217;t reach a conclusion from this study. I remain curious. How many students really die from undetected heart conditions? How many kids saved with an AED device were cleared during a wellness check or sports physical? What is the best way to screen kids to prevent sudden cardiac arrest? I hope that you&#8217;ll remain curious too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An apple a day keeps the doctor away. I heard this as a kid, and now as a parent, I always look for healthy advice and habits to pass on to my kids. This week, the apple became even more important in the prevention of disease. Apple announced that its Series 4 Watch includes an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG).</p>
<p>The ECG was invented in the late 1800s. It’s the machine that displays the squiggly lines, and <u>always</u> flatlines in TV dramas. It is used to detect abnormal heart rhythms and diagnose electrical conditions and heart attacks. It is also a good indicator for certain structural conditions. It is a very useful piece of equipment, but not all ECGs are created equal.</p>
<p>Most ECGs found in a doctor’s office or hospital have 12 leads. They are typically the size of a desktop computer and include ten wires and electrodes (stickers) that connect to the patient’s chest, arms and legs. The machine evaluates the rhythm, conduction and contour of the heart as it monitors the heart’s activity across the body.</p>
<p>The Apple Watch is a one lead ECG so it monitors the heart rhythm from one spot on the body. Its portability makes it great for capturing isolated events and offering insight into potential issues, like aFib in adults. This technology shows lots of promise, but it does not collect enough detail to diagnose heart conditions . . . yet.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death of adults in the United States. It is the #1 cause of death of student athletes and takes the lives of thousands of children every year. Thirteen years ago, my son became one of those statistics so we created a <a href="https://www.simonsheart.org/">heart screening program</a> for students. Let me offer this real life scenario to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>Drew is thirteen. He complains that his heart races. It is hard to know what this really means because Drew is the only one who feels his symptoms. Does Drew consume too much caffeine? Is he an anxious kid? Does he have a heart condition?</p>
<p>Drew comes to our screening. After getting an ECG (12 lead), he is diagnosed with Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome &#8211; an electrical condition. It is possible that the new Apple Watch would have recorded his racing heart. This would’ve provided his parents and doctor with clues about his complaints. It could have led to further testing, the 12 lead ECG, to diagnose his condition. In other words, the watch could have taken the ambiguity out of Drew’s description.</p>
<p>After our screening, Drew underwent a medical procedure called an ablation. The surgery took place on my son’s birthday. Coincidence? Now, he is completely fine and doing well.</p>
<p>We should celebrate this new advancement for what it is. It brings affordable medical technology into our homes. It empowers consumers with valuable information. It raises awareness about heart health. It will give our children insight into how hard their heart works every day. It will help them understand how their heart behaves in certain situations. There’s no doubt that this will lead to a better quality of life.</p>
<p>In the meantime, get your child’s heart screened. <a href="https://www.screenacrossamerica.org/">Check out</a> one of these organizations. It could save their life.</p>

<p>I never thought I’d be challenged this way. I thought that helping parents realize that sudden cardiac arrest was not just an adult thing was productive.

<p>The article only shared Daniel’s story.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Previously posted in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/now-spit_us_584f5a0de4b0151082221e5e">Huffington Post</a> on December 13, 2016</p>
<p>I went to the dentist for my six month check up last week. I didn’t want to be there. Are you surprised? I hate all of the poking and scraping. It was also the day before my daughter’s 14th birthday. I had stuff to do, and places to be. I didn’t have time for this.</p>
<p>So, to keep my mind off of the scraping and poking, I started to wonder what would happen if I just left. Seriously, who needs this? What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>I stayed put, but afterwards, I did a little research. The <a href="https://www.dentalhealth.org/blog/blogdetails/96" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://www.dentalhealth.org/blog/blogdetails/96&quot;}}">Oral Health Foundation</a> claims that the mouth is one of the dirtiest parts of the body, so maybe there is some merit to getting it professionally cleaned. Poor oral hygiene can lead to heart disease, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis and lung conditions.</p>
<p>But wait. The <a href="http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/Dental-Health-and-Heart-Health_UCM_459358_Article.jsp#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:3,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/Dental-Health-and-Heart-Health_UCM_459358_Article.jsp#&quot;}}">American Heart Association</a> contends that there is not enough research to conclude that good oral hygiene prevents heart disease or strokes. So, should I stay or should I go?</p>
<p>Taking off probably won’t kill me, but, it could make my life a little more challenging for things like chewing food.</p>
<p>Experts recommend that we take <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-bites-do-you-take-a-day-try-for-100-1407798123%20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-many-bites-do-you-take-a-day-try-for-100-1407798123%20&quot;}}">100 bites per day</a> (or chews). Most of us don’t do that. Who has time to chew that much? If we did, we would chew 36,500 per year. As the <a href="https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:USA:CAN:GBR&hl=en&dl=en%20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:5,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&idim=country:USA:CAN:GBR&hl=en&dl=en%20&quot;}}">average life expectancy</a> in the U.S. is seventy-nine, our lifetime chew average would be around 2.88 million.</p>
<p>That seems like a lot for something where the consequences are not grave. Not the chewing; all of the maintenance and cleaning.</p>
<p>We are supposed to go the dentist when we get <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=when%20should%20children%20visit%20dentist%20for%20first%20time" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:6,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=when%20should%20children%20visit%20dentist%20for%20first%20time&quot;}}">our first tooth</a>. So, if we start at age 1 and live to seventy-nine, we will spend 78 hours sitting in a dentist’s chair – just for hygiene visits! That doesn’t even count all of the brushing and flossing we do at home. OK, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-02/how-many-americans-floss-their-teeth." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:7,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-05-02/how-many-americans-floss-their-teeth.&quot;}}">nobody really flosses</a>.</p>
<p>I am pro dentist and pro good oral hygiene. I even floss. I’m just struck by the emphasis that we place on good oral hygiene compared to let’s say . . . heart health.</p>
<p>That’s really what was bothering me in the chair. Realizing that my kids get a thorough oral exam twice a year, but they will never be offered a thorough heart exam. For the heart, they will get evaluated only if they complain of symptoms. That usually happens much later in life, and then the damage has already be done.</p>
<p>Why do we practice prevention in oral hygiene but not in cardiac care? We don’t wait for tooth pain to visit a dentist. However, we require pain or discomfort before visiting a cardiologist.</p>
<p>This defies common sense and logic. The heart beats about <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/heart/heartfacts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:8,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/heart/heartfacts.html&quot;}}">35 million times</a> a year or 2,765,000,000 times over the average life span. (That’s almost 1000 times more beating than chewing).</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that we implemented a dental model for cardiology. Once a year, students will receive a thorough cardiac evaluation. A technician, using an electrocardiogram or echocardiogram, will examine the heart. The student will exercise on a treadmill so their pulse and recovery can be evaluated. There is still be time to measure blood pressure and weight. Finally, we can draw blood for cholesterol. We look for plaque on teeth twice a year. It makes sense to look for it in the arteries too. We will compare findings year after year, like they do at the dentist. Why is it that we pay more attention to our teeth than our heart?</p>
<p>Heart conditions are the most common <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/chd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:9,&quot;plid&quot;:&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/chd&quot;}}">birth defect</a>.

The overwhelming majority of these injuries are strains, sprains, fractures, contusions (bruises) and abrasions (scrapes). Fortunately, the prognosis for these types of injuries is very good.</p>
<p>That is not the case for students who experience cardiac arrest. The likely outcome is death. In fact, the survival rate is less than <a href="http://www.ems1.com/cardiac-arrest/articles/2255015-Report-U-S-out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest-survival-rates-unacceptably-low/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:5}}">six percent</a>.

Time is usually not of the essence for these cases.</p>
<p>However, unless you’ve lost a child like I have, or know someone who has, you probably think that sudden cardiac arrest is just an adult thing. It’s not. Sudden cardiac arrest is the <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/sites/default/files/Cardiac_SA_Web10102011.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:8}}">number one</a> cause of death of student athletes. It takes the lives of <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/Understanding-Pediatric-Sudden-Cardiac-Arrest.aspx?nfstatus=401&nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:9}}">thousands</a> of students every year.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. A study showed that <a href="http://www.jabfm.org/content/25/4/408.full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:10}}">seventy-two percent </a>of families who lost a child to cardiac arrest reported that there were warning signs. This conclusion was further corroborated by another <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sudden-cardiac-arrest-may-have-warning-signs-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:11}}">recent study</a>.</p>
<p>So, in children, what are the warning signs of sudden cardiac arrest?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fainting or seizure during or after exercise</li>
<li>unexplained shortness of breath</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>extreme fatigue</li>
<li>racing heart</li>
<li>sudden and unexplained death of a family member under 50</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why the SCAPA is such a great tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents must read and sign a form acknowledging the risks and warnings signs associated with sudden cardiac arrest</li>
<li>Coaches must take an online training course to learn about the warning signs</li>
<li>Coaches must remove players who exhibit symptoms and those players cannot return until cleared by a licensed medical professional.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legislation is budget neutral, meaning that it does not create a cost for the state to implement (other than the cost of printing some forms). As a result, the parents of over two million student athletes have become informed about the risks and warning signs, and two hundred thousand coaches have been educated by the free video produced by <a href="https://www.simonsheart.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:12}}">Simon’s Fund</a> and promoted by the <a href="https://nfhslearn.com/courses/61032/sudden-cardiac-arrest." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:13}}">National Federation of State High Schools Association</a>.</p>
<p>The SCAPA been passed in <a href="/legislation-by-state/">nine states</a>, and adopted by athletic associations in two other states. We were fortunate to collaborate with some amazing organizations on this effort:<a href="http://www.andysmilesforever.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:15}}">Andy Smiles Forever Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.epsavealife.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:16}}">Eric Paredes Save a Life Foundation</a>, <a href="http://givingheartsahand.org/)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:17}}">Giving Hearts a Hand</a>, <a href="http://www.heartinthegame.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:18}}">Heart in the Game</a>, <a href="http://nickoftimefoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:19}}">Nick of Time Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.playforchase.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:20}}">Play for Chase</a>, and <a href="http://whoweplayfor.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-beacon="{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:21}}">Who We Play For</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to hear a lot more about Governor Pence in the coming months. My hope is that, with your help, we’ll also hear a lot more about preventing sudden cardiac arrest among our children.</p>
