<p>Sudden cardiac arrest takes the lives of thousands of children every year. It is the #1 cause of death for student athletes. It kills more adults than lung cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS, combined. But, that’s it.</p>
<p>Simon’s Heart believes that all students should have their <strong>hearts screened<a href="https://simonsheart.heartbytes.org/consent/norristown-heart-screening-9232023-in-memory-of-quentin-watson-2023-09-23">.</a></strong> It should be a cardiac standard of care. And it should be a free heart test.</p>
<p>Research shows that cardiac screenings – when coupled with a good medical history and physical exam – are much more effective at detecting heart conditions than a history and physical alone. A heart screening can do more to prevent sudden cardiac arrest than just questions and listening to the heart.</p>

<p>Without innovative technology, our team wouldn&#8217;t be able to provide life-saving care for children and teens. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re partnering with Sauer&#8217;s Cares for this year&#8217;s annual Baci 5K on May 21st. At each Heart Screening, we turn a community center or high school gym into a clinical space. Data from each screening goes into <a href="/heartbytes/">HeartBytes</a>. HeartBytes is the first-of-its-kind national youth cardiac registry of seemingly healthy kids. In order to function, we use as many as 17 digital tablets to perform a screening. We are so fortunate to be selected by Sauer&#8217;s Cares to receive 100% of their profits from their annual Baci 5K for the 4th year in a row. All profits will go to more tablets, a key in protecting hearts + saving lives from Sudden Cardiac Arrest.</p>
<p>Let’s run and save lives.<span id="more-10015"></span></p>

<p>The Baci 5K is a family friendly run through beautiful Peace Valley Park! All ages are welcome! 100% of the proceeds go towards benefitting <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Simon’s Heart.</a></p>

<p>SIMON’S Heart raises awareness about the warning signs and conditions that lead to sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and death in children. SCA takes the lives of thousands of students every year, and is the #1 cause of death of student athletes. The organization provides free heart screenings, advocates for legislation to protect student athletes, promotes research using its proprietary registry, and distributes AED devices through its crowdfunding website, GotAED.</p>
